The weather was perfect which made sitting outside overlooking their grounds an absolute pleasure.  Our waitress was excellent and our food arrived quickly on the semi-busy Saturday morning.  It looked like the place fills up pretty quickly so the earlier you get here the better.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get their Bloody Mary.  It was phenomenal and simply the best I've ever had.  I'm pretty sure they only use ingredients from their garden and blend them fresh when you order it.  It was amazing.\n\nWhile EVERYTHING on the menu looks excellent, I had the white truffle scrambled eggs vegetable skillet and it was tasty and delicious.  It came with 2 pieces of their griddled bread with was amazing and it absolutely made the meal complete.  It was the best \"toast\" I've ever had.\n\nAnyway, I can't wait to go back!","5":"review","6":"rLtl8ZkDX5vH5nAx9C3q5Q","7":"2","8":"5","9":"0"},{"0":"ZRJwVLyzEJq1VAihDhYiow","1":"2011-07-27","2":"IjZ33sJrzXqU-0X6U8NwyA","3":"5","4":"I have no idea why some people give bad reviews about this place. It goes to show you, you can please everyone. They are probably griping about something that their own fault...there are many people like that.\n\nIn any case, my friend and I arrived at about 5:50 PM this past Sunday. It was pretty crowded, more than I thought for a Sunday evening and thought we would have to wait forever to get a seat but they said we'll be seated when the girl comes back from seating someone else. We were seated at 5:52 and the waiter came and got our drink orders. Everyone was very pleasant from the host that seated us to the waiter to the server. The prices were very good as well. We placed our orders once we decided what we wanted at 6:02. We shared the baked spaghetti calzone and the small \"Here's The Beef\" pizza so we can both try them. The calzone was huge and we got the smallest one (personal) and got the small 11\" pizza. Both were awesome! My friend liked the pizza better and I liked the calzone better. The calzone does have a sweetish sauce but that's how I like my sauce!\n\nWe had to box part of the pizza to take it home and we were out the door by 6:42. So, everything was great and not like these bad reviewers. That goes to show you that  you have to try these things yourself because all these bad reviewers have some serious issues.","5":"review","6":"0a2KyEL0d3Yb1V6aivbIuQ","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"6oRAC4uyJCsJl1X0WZpVSA","1":"2012-06-14","2":"IESLBzqUCLdSzSqm0eCSxQ","3":"4","4":"love the gyro plate.

The restaurant seemed fairly full even on a Tuesday evening; we had secured reservations just a couple days before.\n\nMy friend and I had sampled sandwiches at the Farm Kitchen earlier that week, and were impressed enough to want to eat at the restaurant.  The crisp, fresh veggies didn't disappoint: we ordered the salad with orange and grapefruit slices and the crudites to start.  Both were very good; I didn't even know how much I liked raw radishes and turnips until I tried them with their pesto and aioli sauces.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the lamb and my friend ordered the pork shoulder.  Service started out very good, but trailed off quickly.  Waiting for our food took a very long time (a couple seated after us received and finished their entrees before we received our's), and no one bothered to explain the situation until the maitre'd apologized almost 45 minutes later.  Apparently the chef was unhappy with the sauce on my entree, so he started anew.  This isn't really a problem, but they should have communicated this to us earlier.  For our troubles, they comped me the glass of wine I ordered, but they forgot to bring out with my entree  as I had requested.  Also, they didn't offer us bread, but I will echo the lady who whispered this to us on her way out: ask for the bread.  We received warm foccacia, apple walnut, and pomegranate slices of wonder with honey and butter.  YUM.\n\nThe entrees were both solid, but didn't quite live up to the innovation and freshness of the vegetables.  My lamb's sauce was delicious, but the meat was tough.  Maybe the vegetarian entrees are the way to go?  But our dessert, the gingerbread pear cake, was yet another winner.\n\nIf the entrees were tad more inspired, or the service weren't so spotty, this place definitely would have warranted five stars.  If I return, I'd like to try the 75$ tasting menu.  Our bill came out to about 100$ for two people, including tip, no drinks.","5":"review","6":"sqYN3lNgvPbPCTRsMFu27g","7":"4","8":"3","9":"1"},{"0":"zp713qNhx8d9KCJJnrw1xA","1":"2010-02-12","2":"riFQ3vxNpP4rWLk_CSri2A","3":"5","4":"Drop what you're doing and drive here. After I ate here I had to go back the next day for more.  The food is that good.\n\nThis cute little green building may have gone competely unoticed if I hadn't been driving down Palm Rd to avoid construction.  While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!\n\nIt looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!\n\nAs if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!  I'm a sucker for Mexican folk art and Frida Kahlo is my Oprah.  There's a painting of her and Diego hanging over the salsa bar, it's amazing.  All the paintings are great, love the artist.","5":"review","6":"wFweIWhv2fREZV_dYkz_1g","7":"7","8":"7","9":"4"},{"0":"hW0Ne_HTHEAgGF1rAdmR-g","1":"2012-07-12","2":"JL7GXJ9u4YMx7Rzs05NfiQ","3":"4","4":"Luckily, I didn't have to travel far to make my connecting flight.

I looked up Irish bars in town and found Rosie's. The decor and ambience was outstanding. I went there by myself on a Wednesday night in hopes of finding some friendly folks and that is exactly what happened. I ate dinner at the bar. Marcy was the bartender and she was very friendly and helpful and she introduced me to a whole bunch of people. For dinner I had a Rueben sandwich, which was pretty large and very good. I had a a small Rosie salad as my side and it did the job. I wish it was made with lettuce other than iceburg, but the bacon & eggs & other toppings helped a whole lot. I drank a nice, cold Smithwick's from the tap. Followed that up with 2 vodka tonics and my whole tab was under $25! \n\nThe basketball game was on when I first got there. After the game, the jukebox was playing a fabulous mix of the best oldies. Around 10pm a live band played. I didn't catch much of their performance but I did notice that I really like the singer's voice and that's rare for me since I don't typically care for female vocalists.\n\n\nAll the people I spoke to were super nice and very welcoming. I am sure I will see a bunch (or all) of them again and I look forward to that!","5":"review","6":"JOG-4G4e8ae3lx_szHtR8g","7":"1","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"Vb9FPCEL6Ly24PNxLBaAFw","1":"2011-03-20","2":"HvqmdqWcerVWO3Gs6zbrOw","3":"2","4":"Was it worth the 21$ for a salad and small pizza?

Wow that would have been nice if the guy told us that. I left hungry, mad and unsatisfied. \n\nTo the owner: teach your employees the value of upselling and telling the specials.

They had brunch specials going on, including $2 bloody mary's and mimosas, but we were more in the mood for lunch.  Except for the bloody mary, I had to try one.  It came out in a high-ball-sized glass.  Boo!  But it was really tasty. Yay!  The hubby remembered a sign outside the restaurant a few weeks back that said they had Arrogant Bastard, and he got a 22 oz bottle for $4.75.  Hey, that's not fair!!\n\nNext up: the wings.  We were a bit hesitant to order them when the waitress informed us that they are \"seasoned\" but not sauced, so they can't be ordered hot.  We did ask for them crispy though, and the waitress even asked the cooks to throw them back in for a few minutes when they came out not visibly crispy.  These non-traditional wings were actually pretty damn good.  The seasoning was a little spicy and salty with just a hint of sweet.  If I were in the mood for the tang and kick of Frank's Hot Sauce, these wouldn't cut it, but otherwise they were good enough to go back again for.\n\nMy entree was the Tilapia salad, and I was a bit disappointed.  The fish was a bit dry and uninspired. And the greens underneath were overdressed and wilted.  I ate the greens around the fish and picked out the almonds and Mandarin oranges, but I had to leave the mush hiding underneath the fish.\n\nIt wasn't bad enough to say I wouldn't go back, but I won't be anxiously awaiting my next trip.","5":"review","6":"SBbftLzfYYKItOMFwOTIJg","7":"3","8":"4","9":"2"},{"0":"O510Re68mOy9dU490JTKCg","1":"2010-05-03","2":"j4SIzrIy0WrmW4yr4--Khg","3":"5","4":"okay this is the best place EVER! i grew up shopping at the one in los gatos, and the one in Oakville. i was shock when i saw the best store in the world in Scottsdale and then not surprised at all. the have all the good stuff. from cheese down to wine. i can't tell you how happy i am that this store is here in Arizona. now if we could just get dean and deluca!","5":"review","6":"u1KWcbPMvXFEEYkZZ0Yktg","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"b5cEoKR8iQliq-yT2_O0LQ","1":"2009-03-06","2":"v0cTd3PNpYCkTyGKSpOfGA","3":"3","4":"I met a friend for lunch yesterday. \n\nLoved the water feature and patio walking in, if it had been warmer I would have definitely sat outside. \n\nInside was a little dark and I guess it was all the bats around but it reminded me of \"Dusk Till Dawn\". \n\nWe were seated, I hope was hoping for chips and salsa, I guess they don't serve them here? \nWe weren't even offered the ones on the menu, which I probably would have declined anyway because chips and salsa should be complimentary. \n\nAnyhow I ordered the Fresh Snapper Tacos (see pics) \nThere is a lot of fish there being smothered by all those peppers, but as for everything else what you see is what you get.\n\nFor $15 I would have liked more than a TBSP of each, rice and beans, and a DEFINITELY more than a teaspoon of cheese and sour cream and maybe a lime or lemon. \nThere was more garnish on the plate than anything.

I couldn't decide what to get but that didn't matter because the other 3 people I went with chose for me.  I wanted something basic but they insisted on sharing the 'patte' thing.  It is a few scoops of ice cream over a brownie and topped with whip cream and caramel.  While it was very good it just wasn't what I wanted.  Next time I'm just going to get a scoop or 2 of the ice cream so I can really taste what the ice cream is all about.  It is just too difficult to tell when it is topped with a bunch of stuff.

I was pleasantly surprised! The store had a good amount of parking, and the store front was clean, open and had adequate seating around the perimeters. There were already 5-6 people sitting and waiting for their cars to be finished, and 2 people waiting infront of me to see a representative. All the guys working there were busy helping someone, yet were saying hello to us and reassuring they'd get to us very soon. I didn't wait an unneccesary amount of time and then was helped by Wally. He inspected my tires, recommended a plan of action gave me options, and we headed back into the store. After I made my decision to replace 2 of the tires, he checked their stock, and unfortunately they didn't have them there. BUT he called another store and had them picked up for the next morning, so I could just come back the next day to this same store and get those bad boys installed. Great! The prices were not as heafty (relief), and although there were a good amount of people the next day waiting for their cars to also be serviced, it took exactly the amount of time they'd told me (45 min). They apologized for the wait, but no need for that! The guy who helped me on the 2nd day (I'm sorry I forgot his name) was also very professional and great. I recommend this store and will be bringing my car here in the future most definitely. Thanks, guys!\n\nTIP: If you know you need to bring your car in, you can make an appointment with them online. They take walk-ins, but I believe it helps them manage their customers easier, and that in turn benefits you.","5":"review","6":"HLbhD2OyiMCUDRR4c1iXaw","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"qjmCVYkwP-HDa35jwYucbQ","1":"2010-03-28","2":"2VTwjhOX3UUvgOGbxe4xfA","3":"4","4":"I went here again when I got back to Phoenix after being gone for six months.

I thought to myself, \"how nice\", they read my review and they are concerned about the quality of their product.  I think that is admirable.  I did not take them up on the offer, because I don't feel that would be appropriate - I'm interested in doing yelp reviews because I have benefitted from reading the reviews of others, and I want to share my thoughts and feelings too :-) - I'm not looking for freebies.\n\nSo, anyway, last friday seemed like a good day to walk over to LGO and see what's shakin.  I grabbed my growler jug (still the best deal around) and the wife, called a friend to join us for a beer and walked on down to the corner.  The evening was a bit on the warm side, but it was quiet and about the normal buzz of busyness for this corner.  It's always kinda crazy and we like to sit on the patio to watch the manic drivers race around trying to find parking.  We went into the store and the wife ordered a grilled-fish sandwich.  I nervously ordered a cheeseburger with fries.  After placing our orders and getting warned that we needed to be around to pick them up, I moseyed over to the bar to get my jug filled with Stella.  Did I mention that this is an awesome deal?  So, we got some glasses and headed out to the patio.  Soon afterward, they called our name and we got our grub.  My wife's fish sandwich was consumed with muffled oooh's and ahhhhs', and she raved about the perfect texture, grilled flavor and delicious, fresh multi-grain bread.  She also raved about the slaw that came with it.  I think she liked this sandwich.  The burger, on the other hand, is still a disappointment.  I ordered it Medium Rare (the only way to order a burger) and kudos to the woman for not warning me about undercooked meats - I'm aware.  really. And I asked for cheese and put it on a hamburger bun.  It came open-faced with a pile of coarsly shredded mild cheddar cheese.  It had the appropriate veggies - lettuce, pickle and tomato, red onion slices and the special sauce.  With a pile of limp matchstick fries on the side, it was a big pile-o-food.  The portion was impressive.  That's about where it ended for me.  The burger was overcooked and the pile of shredded cheese is a bit off-putting.  It's impressive, I'll give 'em that, but a big pile of cold, shredded cheese just doesn't work for me.  The cheese needs to be melted.  A good burger has the cheese melted.  at least some.  Lot's of cheese can be fun, but it overpowers the rest of the flavors and tends to cool the burger quickly.  I scraped off about two-thirds of the cheese - enough to make a cheese crisp if I had a tortilla, and put the burger together.  Flavor was so-so.  After I added some salt and pepper, flavor was just a little better than so-so.  Burger was cooked to med-well, but still juicy.  The veggies were fresh and crispy.  A side of mayo for dipping the fries in is required for me.  I like my fries Belgian style.  The bun was a little dry and on the edge of stale, but not bad enough that I could not eat it still.  Overall, I stand by my original review of the burgers here.  I realize LGO is trying to stand out with a \"different\" presentation, and I applaud the effort, but I think it needs a bit more work to stand out at a time when everybody is doing burgers.  The fries were sub-par, limp and forgettable.  The ambiance, however, is what brings us back.  Sitting on the corner patio, sipping a beer, having a great conversation and watching the show all around me is a great way to wind down on a warm Friday night.  LGO - keep working on the burger, I'll keep coming in, but I think I'll stick with the wings for now.","5":"review","6":"J3I2NClEbD1Xr8lOdjxlqQ","7":"1","8":"2","9":"1"},{"0":"EC9WB-iVjd28B6R6KIZ8TA","1":"2010-08-04","2":"RZZ9Tf5GWYwrcjg-ACiKmQ","3":"4","4":"Cliff notes\n- Cheap: $1-2/plate\n- Fast: It's ready-to-go and on a conveyor\n- Acceptable quality: I'm here weekly and haven't gotten sick lol\n\nThis place is definitely good for what it is, \"it\" being a budget-friendly sushi place that's great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so they're gonna have to \"reduce costs\" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but it's still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.\n\nOn top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All that's required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). \n\nI've never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).\n\nFor those claiming to be \"left to fend for themselves\" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called \"the menu\" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as \"descriptions\" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, there's even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand?

I'm on a constant quest to find that  Ideal expressed in Real Life. \n\nVintage 95 isn't quite there, but it's damn close. If I ever give something Five Stars, you'll know it has pegged my Platonic Ideal. Anyway...\n\nThe plan last night was for drinks. No plans for food, just Adult Beverages and warm conversation. But it turned into more.\n\nThe location in downtown Chandler is terrific for us. The owners have created a very fine visual experience - leather, stone, dark woods, good lighting. And they don't have the music turned up so loud that you CANNOT HAVE A CONVERSATION. This is one of my pet peeves. If I want to stare at people move their mouths while enduring an aural assault, I'll stand on the deck of an aircraft carrier. When I go out with friends, I want to enjoy their company AND their conversation. Is that concept so difficult to grasp? [/rant off]\n\nThe atmosphere at Vintage 95 is very close to my Ideal. I'd go back just to sit on the leather couches in front of the fireplace, and then go back another time to sit on the leather stools at the bar, and then go back about fourteen more times to sit out on the patio. Seriously - go check out the patio. It is EXACTLY what a Patio Hangout Bar should be. EXACTLY.\n\nCaroline and I told the hostesses we were only there for drinks, so we were seated in the bar area in some fabulous leather club chairs. It wasn't initmate, but we weren't looking for intimate. And speaking of the bar, even though V95 advertises itself as a wine bar, they DO have booze. I'm not much of a wine drinker and was very pleased to see that they carried a pretty good selection of single malt scotches. Not an overwhelming selection, but well beyond the normal Glenfiddich /Glenlivit /GlenMorangie trio to which most places are limited. I had a couple of drums of Ardbeg, which is one of my new favorites and very reasonably priced at retail. (Scotch is never reasonably priced in restaurants, but I was celebrating so I didn't care.) Caroline had her normal \"vodka martini extra dirty extra cold\" which she judged to have \"perfect dirtiness\", (no wonder I love her!), perfect amount of olives and very cold. \n\nThe limited Happy Hour menu had some very interesting choices. We settled on the bruschetta and the smoked tomato bisque. The bruschetta was VERY nice and quite unusual. You get to select four of eight choices for your bruschetta platter; we picked: (1) white bean and pancetta, (2) gravlax, caper goat cheese and pickled onions, (3) fig chutney, ricotta and prosciutto, (4) brie, pear and onion jam. They were all served cold, in nice sized portions and the flavors were all nicely balanced and very interesting. Caroline would have preferred the bread to not be so crispy, but I really liked it. The tomato bisque  was creamy, smoky and had well-balanced flavor. Caroline said it was unique and I say it was just darn delicious. \n\nThings being as they are, drinks and appetizers turned into food. A friend had told us \"you have to try the Vintage burger\", so we did. It came served with a mixture of regular and sweet potato fries, all nicely cooked and nicely seasoned. Recommended. The burger was VERY tasty. They obviously use good beef, the bun was fresh, the fixin's were tasty. HIGHLY recommended.\n\nIn for a dime, in for a dollar, right? So we ordered dessert. Again, the dessert menu is short, but I'm okay with that as long as they do it well. Chocolate torte with hazelnut gelato, apple pie with carmel sauce and creme fraiche gelato, and something else we couldn't remember. I'm allergic to hazelnut and don't like sweet desserts, so we decided to try the apple pie.\n\nLike everything else we had sampled, the apple pie was unusual - you wouldn't find it anywhere else. It was served on a freshly baked puff pastry, cubed apples served on top and inside - tender but not mushy -  with lots of cinnamon and sugar, plate was swirled with salted dolce la leche. It was tasty, but instead of the expected creme fraiche gelato, we were served hazelnut gelato. I didn't realize it was hazelnut until I'd had a couple of bites and my throat started to swell up.\n\nAt this point that the night could have turned into a disaster, but to their credit - it didn't. We told the waiter who told the manager, (Gavin - one of the owners), who immediately came and asked if I needed emergency assistance. I didn't, I'm not THAT allergic.)  Frankly, their response was EXACTLY the kind of customer service you want to see. Anyone can make a mistake, so no harm, no foul. But I must give BIG Kudos to Gavin for his kindness, attention to detail and outstanding customer service.\n\nWe will DEFINTELY be back and I strongly recommend you put it on your list too.","5":"review","6":"40aklZ2SQPKnlTPZdvAqww","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"tA2DT7CGQPzgA6tTcTkXDw","1":"2009-09-02","2":"VyX6x7wnThr9g9Z6VBDIgA","3":"2","4":"I have to add to Andrew's review.....\n\nI just can't believe the things that happened!!\n\nYes the app was good.  The entree was good too, but there were bites of just bread with no chicken in the panini.  It definitely would have been better with more chicken!\n\nBut the girl working here is one of the worst waitress/bartender/hostesses EVER!\n\nWhen we walked in, she didn't even sit us.  We stood there forever waiting until she finally told us to seat ourselves.  We went outside since there was nothing left inside.  It was too hot outside so we came back in and figured we'd sit at the bar.  Luckily a nice guy noticed us looking around and let us sit at the end of his table that he moved apart since his whole party didn't show up for dinner.\n\nI was so excited when I saw they had cider on their menu!  And not just one, but two that I like!  Wyder's Pear Cider and Strongbow!!  \nI ordered a Wyder's.  After I finished it and asked for another, she said they were out of them.  Okay, so I ordered a strongbow.  She came back and poured it into a glass for me.  When I took a drink it was disgusting!!  It was Boddington's!!!!  When I finally got her attention away from flirting with a man sitting at the bar to ask her for the correct drink, she told me they were out of Strongbow too!  How are you out of both drinks??  You're a restaurant.  Shouldn't it be stocked?  You're right across from a BevMo for god's sake!\n\nWhen we ordered our food, he ordered the app.  Then I ordered my entree and she walked away!  She didn't even get his order!!!!  We figured it was probably for the best.  We'd split the app and the entree and eat less.  Stupid of the waitress to lose money that way, but whatever.\n\nWhen she brought my food, she didn't bring the correct things.  How hard is it to remember?  She had maybe 4 tables to take care of!  Maybe if she stopped texting while she's behind the bar on her cell phone or if she'd stop having a conversation with the guy at the bar, maybe she could have done her job a little better.","5":"review","6":"UL9chyH0a4Pj8J_9M6WSpA","7":"1","8":"2","9":"2"},{"0":"o5x6DF0KK1OBsiUOx2gavg","1":"2010-02-04","2":"IRGqHYbK5AOEv5MNYMz7cQ","3":"4","4":"This would most certainly be \"my\" coffee shop if I hadn't already established myself as a regular at another local shop.

Our guy, though adorable and friendly, was too busy to refill our drinks and to remember to bring our appetizer (though charged us for it). The ahi tuna (highly recommended over the other fish options he said) was so overcooked it was the color and consistency of chicken.

You may have to wait for a table but the waits are never excessive and there is the coffee trolley where you can help yourself while waiting.  Even more remarkable is that even at its busiest (read Mothers/ Fathers days), service is speedy and attentive and the kitchen never seems to slow down.  Someone here knows how to run a restaurant!\n\nThe menu contains a large assortment of the usual breakfast fare, eggs, pancakes, french toast, etc, all well prepared and tasty.  In addition there are is a good number of health conscious offerings and even those less healthy dishes can be requested to be made with egg whites or egg beaters, and non-starch substitutes (cottage cheese, fruit, and tomatoes. etc).  Some of my favorites include the Hey Ricky Omelet, Huevos Ranchero ,or my indulgence a (as in one huge singular)  buckwheat pancake with (my choice of \"fillings): chocolate chips ( I admit my addictions), pecans, and bananas... \n\nWe always opt for the patio and even in the scorching summer heat; the misters make this a great outdoor picnic with the best people watching in Phoenix.\n\nAfter you have been here a few times you feel like part of the family and with their frequent dinner program they offer even more incentive to return.","5":"review","6":"t8vH6ubd-6i9DTisZaQdgg","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"pRmHreZcF7YmNEEPukfcFg","1":"2008-06-13","2":"SWdrx60taMa442b1enwfCw","3":"5","4":"I absolutely love this little spot!

And they do the most amazing wrap jobs, making gift giving even easier.\n\nThe final bonus is their annual Clearance sale. For three days each year they basically blow out their stock to make way for new finds.

I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.

Reminiscent of a trendy hipster coffee joint, this is actually a casual vegan restaurant. \n\nI am a pescatarian and unless I am eating seafood, I steer clear of meat, even the mock kind usually however once in a while it's delicious... so why try it here at Green I thought. The menu's style is comfort food, which as we all know traditionally is heavy on the meat, sauces, and fat content... so at least if you're going to be bad, you can do it with organic and pure ingredients.\n\n\nSo as I wanted to sample as much of the menu as possible, my lovely friend, her fiance, and I shared a few items:\n\n*Artichoke Gratine: The corn chips were amazing, lightly salted and crisp. The dip was a bit too garlicky and runny for my liking. Ate a few bites of this but could not see myself eating the entire thing solo.\n\n*Spicy Buffalo \"Wings\": first things first... do not let looks dismay you... true it looks gross but they taste legit! The flavor of the buffalo sauce was perfect, although could have been spicier. And the cucumber ranch dipping sauce was perfectly creamy and lightly flavored as to not overpower the \"wings\". This dish is a must try!!\n\n*Vegan Chili Fries: the fries are thin cut and tasty. The chili sauce was good, at first, but I quickly got sick of the flavor. This could be because I was never a huge chili fan even back when I ate meat. Hmm, I think you are better off ordering the thyme fries.\n\n*Crab Puffs: Perfectly crisp with a delicious creamy filling. Another must try!\n\nLastly my friend's fiance ordered that day's special which was a green chili burrito... delicious and huge. A bit too much rice but besides that a great option. It came with a side, which he ordered the curry pasta salad, mmm.\n\n\nGreen serves bowls, sandwiches, pizzas, salads... next time I am back in the area I will be checking out more of the menu when craving \"meat\" and not my usual tofu, seafood, veggie diet.  \n\nMight I add the service is friendly. Perfect place for a casual friend date.","5":"review","6":"YBVdmm5zlpLpi2_DiKsd2A","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"5kRug3bEienrpovtPRVVwg","1":"2012-06-29","2":"BslISEau8Pk2voEPN7kY-g","3":"4","4":"Rokerij is worth the hype.

The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries.

After seeing his body transform to only 16.2% body fat, all his jeans get too big on him and fill out his American Apparel briefs nicely I was super jealous. He raved about his teacher and I could tell he had de-stressed a lot since he started the practice.\n\nLuckily, she opened up a studio recently, and it simply goregous. The waiting area is filled with yoga material and a very calming space with a remodeled bathroom and dressing rooms to change if coming from work/school. Not at all cheesy like the SouthWest Inst with the way too many angels imagery (creepy!). But the gem is truly the practice space. Hardwood floors, high ceilings, a beautiful staircase, tasteful decorations and absolutely NO MIRRORS.  \n\nThat is right- the only person staring at my pudge rolls is my teacher and who-ever isn't focusing on their tree posture-not the entire class! It really relieves a lot of stress  and helps me concentrate on how a posture feels as opposed to just looks.\n\nAs for Tish Hegel, she is simply outstanding-she has so many credentials, you have to read her biography for yourself. She has been practicing for a loooong time, and her hands-on instruction and confident voice echoes in my ears even now (bring those shoulders down!). \n\nSo far, I have done:  Ashtanga Inspired Flow (pretty intense, really hurt for 3 days, would recommend after getting into yoga for a while), Sivananda (ditto),  Focus Class (did a lot of bike riding and she focused on everybody's body issues and did the sequence right then and there for us and my lower back and knees felt amazing the day after) and this morning brought my friend to Kinetic Yoga: Morning Movement and Flow, which kicked our 6am asses a little bit but we both felt amazing afterwards!  She does tons of modifications, is always making sure we are okay, and is just super personable.\n\nI did the huge package since I didn't renew my ASU gym membership for this summer, but you can do drop-in. \n\nNow for the cliched Yoga Review ending: \n\nNAMASTE!","5":"review","6":"mfvezpz6ohS0NQk3DZdvqQ","7":"11","8":"16","9":"8"},{"0":"8ZwO9VuLDWJOXmtAdc7LXQ","1":"2010-10-31","2":"bxPZPvBJp5HwyKVHhcUMLQ","3":"4","4":"Great hotel in Central Phoenix for a stay-cation, but not necessarily a place to stay out of town and without a car.

Definitely recommend the TPC.","5":"review","6":"Y9LxzNvQxKwLhy2Zo7R_4w","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"vARjqeIkSNsazHltujiq4Q","1":"2010-05-18","2":"aRcp0rlSuAiuF-CDDZx9nQ","3":"5","4":"I can't describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste!

None of us had been here before and it came highly recommended by my dad.  As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!","5":"review","6":"v10WwWFKPAK6aKjghrLj3g","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"CrBsdxqOjPdnfsDxV89GJQ","1":"2010-02-17","2":"SmUMyCUNrT9HEo_DXdgUuQ","3":"4","4":"I have to admit that I find myself thinking that I like mine tall dark and Russian. \n\n It's nice to have a coffee shop near by that's not Starbucks, has good coffee and reasonable prices.

I have tried the blueberry muffin-quite yummy as well as the chocolate chip cookies- delicious.

It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.\nAs consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card \"holidays\".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for \"corking fees\", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.\nCoup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.","5":"review","6":"GVH_iuoPc0aP3ZNYlWuKag","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"WaO_hAunQrZ--vI308rHQA","1":"2011-06-06","2":"4jkSNOjZN-35vo1_Z2SL7w","3":"3","4":"Great food and awesome service!

I had originally been heading down the street to Regal on 7th Ave.--who does a fine job in half the pickup time--for the \"advertised\" fake price here. Trying to make the best of it,  I told the lady at least I'd learned they had an onsite alteration service, and maybe that was worth a buck. UH OH. Picked up my skirt a few weeks later with some Jersey Shore-type chick at the counter, and was told I owed another $3.79. I flat-out refused to pay twice. She screamed at me, chased me to my car, wrote down my license plate and said the police would be visiting.

They have some crazy ingredients like varied sauces and mayos, fresh spinach, grilled peppers, and all sorts of other things you don't see at a typical deli. Then they serve it up on a baguette, wrap, or wheat bread for about $6. The specials are particularly diverse and change daily. On the other side of the coin, their website is horrible and occasionally we find some things missing or not quite right, but we chalk that up to charm and whimsy. (We get a weekly Sacks delivery.)\n\nIf you want a basic ham and cheese sandwich, you can get that here. If you want a sandwich like their Blue Bayou, which is spicy marinated chicken served with bacon, bleu cheese crumbles, cheddar jack, mushrooms, spinach, and chipotle mayo, all melted down, well, you can get that here too, but only on the days when it's a special. \n\nFrom their regular, artist-inspired menu, their Dali is an instant classic take on the egg salad: This one comes with lettuce, bacon, cream cheese, mayo, and tomato, on 12-grain bread. The Encore has prime steak, melted provolone, hot/mild/or mixed peppers, feta yogurt or marinara sauce, lettuce, tomato, and parmesan for $6.30. Seriously, give this place a shot and you won't be disappointed. \n\nOh, and every sandwich comes with a lovely cookie. Brilliant.","5":"review","6":"8-2W5CmkDl9vrkxRpkiPRg","7":"1","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"0RqNRc6RiILzZxK9J8Kqug","1":"2012-03-03","2":"2dEtB3h8yZEONOmUJIUPZQ","3":"2","4":"This is my first time back in years.

Nothing too special.  \n\nOverall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  \n\nJust a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.

Build-your-own  Pork tacos.  Talk about tender meat!!  The shoulder of pork literally fell right off onto the fork.  The tortillas were exceptional, and so was the tasty sauce which included pineapple glaze.  So, the food was absolutely delicious...but the service was equally impressive.  My water level never reached the bottom of the glass the entire night, and I drink plenty!  Everyone was incredibly nice and cheerfully said \"Happy Valentine's Day!\" and \"Happy Birthday!\" to my fiance', which made the experience even better.  A fantastic place that I'll have no problem recommending to others to visit!","5":"review","6":"cCwj4RJSKU4-o9ZZ1VTtmA","7":"1","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"qkbloHdDZuHf_0wTqUGPjQ","1":"2012-06-08","2":"mmAi-uXUcfWLnH8qK2gfug","3":"5","4":"I have had a great experience every time I have been there.

Yes, it's in the Sheraton, and yes it's near the airport with not much else around, but I have to say- we were both impressed. \n\nWe started with the Gambas al Fuego, which were deliciously spicy (although I thought that $10 for four shrimp was a bit excessive, no matter how tasty they were). We both had house salads with blue cheese dressing- I think you can tell a lot about the quality of a place by their salads. They used fresh field greens, the tomatoes were perfect and sweet, and even the thinly sliced onions were sweet and delicious. The blue cheese dressing was fantastic, and had actual chunks of blue cheese. I was impressed, for a hotel restaurant. For our entrees, I had the hickory smoked baby back ribs (good, but not phenomenal) and husband ordered the chorizo chicken- I am so glad he shared a bite with me, because it was awesome. I was really wishing I'd gotten that instead of the ribs. Oh, and I especially wanted to mention the asparagus that came with my ribs- tender, cooked just right, and flavorful. This place uses quality ingredients.\n\nIf it wasn't so out of the way, we would definitely come by regularly. My husband was especially enticed by the prime rib melt sandwich, so I think we'll be back during lunch in the near future. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 5 stars was that the atmosphere was pretty dead. Which I suppose is understandable, given that it's inside the Sheraton. The decor was nice though. They should have a free standing restaurant in an area with more traffic- this place would be a hit.","5":"review","6":"4B6aJJTELjivUXrL_LTlqQ","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"nFo_63pTr-4ZhakuaRFOCA","1":"2012-03-30","2":"L1ur4N-XFG_kviP0M2_SCA","3":"5","4":"I love this restaurant!!

Maybe it was the panini bread. I think the parmesan pasta was made there, but I know for sure the macaroni was not made there, it tasted like something I had at a picnic which was in a carton. It wasn't anything to brag home about. \n\nI found out the head chef made my sandwich... keep him in the kitchen and away from the customers, no personality whatsoever. I asked for his suggestion, and his reaction was \"anythings good.\" \n\nNormally, when I go to AJ's, I go for their desserts.

However, I was very dissapointed with the service I received.  I'll type the one sarcastic comment that I can't get out of my head and then I'll get to the more substantial feedback.  I thought a detail was supposed to be a little more DETAILED.\n\nHere are the positives, because I want to give credit where credit is due.  The guys come to you and are very polite.  They were a little delayed, but called to let me know which I appreciated.  Also, they do a great job at steam cleaning the carpets and the exterior wax job was awesome.\n\nOn to the negatives.  When I came out to see the work they did, I immediately noticed several smudges in the interior which they cleaned after I pointed them out.  Also, I noticed a scratch on the passenger side leather seat and a hole punched in the carpet near the pedals.  Anyone who knows me knows that I am a DETAIL oriented person.  Those defects were not present in my car prior to this job.  To add to this bit of a let-down, a day later my boyfriend and I noticed that they didn't even touch my trunk!  They didn't even bother to vacuum it out!\n\nWhen you advertise on your website \"showroom quality,\" I expect showroom quality.

A sandwich made with seared, lightly breaded haddock, sliced hard-boiled egg, fresh basil, romaine lettuce, tomato, Provencal tartar sauce on a grilled Brioche roll. The brioche was amazing. It was light and fluffy. The haddock was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of breading, and the vegetables were fresh and in perfect proportions as to not overpower the bread and haddock. Sometimes when you go to a sandwich shop they overload it with everything else that the meat and bread are just there to accessorize the vegetables and sauce. This was perfectly done. The atmosphere is pleasant and open with nice music as the light smell of fresh bread in the background salivates me. This is a must-visit lunch time destination. Dinner review shortly.","5":"review","6":"kxfUWPT6PuwieZHonfXtLw","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"SMpL3z4FLF07bRA6-y22JQ","1":"2009-04-05","2":"2bPgTaY62Jc_FoTtXz35lg","3":"5","4":"What a wonderful night. It didn't start out that way. I found this restaurant on yelp, not realizing that it was sixteen miles from the hotel my wife and i were staying at. I heard the grief all the way there. \"Come on honey, it's an adventure!\". \n\nWe arrived, and were greeted warmly and shown right to our table. Zach, our waiter, was right there to offer us drinks and appetizers. We had the Summer Rolls and they were delicious! \n\nI explained to  Zach that I was allergic to wheat and he brought us a special \"gluten free\" menu the owner had created for those of us who are allergic to wheat. Zach even brought us some special wheat-free dipping sauce for the Summer rolls. He showed great care, provided great customer service,  and the sauce  was delicious!\n\nThe portions were good sized and the presentation was beautiful. But the wonderful tastes and personal service made the night special. Oh, the bathrooms were clean too. Thanks Zach, and thanks Malee's. It was a great night my wife and I look forward to repeating.

I was a little disappointed that the Butterfly Pavillion had closed for the day at 5:00pm, and several walking areas were being used for weddings/receptions (who could blame these people??) but still got to see a lot of beautiful desert plants and wildlife.  We managed to get in for free, not sure if it was because of the time of the day or all the people just walking in for the weddings though, which totally made the park that much more fun.  I am not sure I would have gotten as much enjoyment out of it if I'd had to pay $5 to get in...\n\nThe little desert rat-sqirrels, and rabbits were totally fun to try to find hiding in the many different plants and burrows.  I felt like a little kid ooh-ing and ah-ing at the different varieties of cacti and desert wildflowers, and have to give this place the ultimate rating .

Lots of beautiful decorations to stare at while you're waiting for friends to arrive, and the staff as well as fellow patrons are always very friendly.\n\nWhen I feel like getting in touch with my hippie side I go to Casey Moores, because I can always expect to find someone outside painting a work of art, or photographing the wandering cats (yes, they have cats! they're well-fed and happy). \n\nIt gets pretty busy after 5pm, but the good news is that if you arrive before 5 you can bring your pets and stay all night. I bring my dog in all the time, and she is always met with animal lovers who didn't know they could bring their pets.. so now you know!\n\nThe oysters are good, but if you're eating them out on the patio the heat kind of kills that deal for you.

A relatively new business to the complex on 16th St and Bell Rd. \n\nGils is NOT your average Mexican Style food. It is New Mexican Style. They use whole beans, no lard and light on flavor. The rice is not orange but more of a yellow with hints of garlic infused. The burritos are covered in red or green sauce, which can be a hot or mild depending on the crop. \n\nI had the pork Carnita's burrito topped with green sauce. Beans and rice. I would have been disappointed it I expected smashed refried beans too. BUT I love the beans as they are. They are sort of like a ham hock style bean. The carnitas was wonderful and huge. filled with pork and not a spec of fat in it. Topped with cheese and Hatch Green Chilie sauce. Did I mention Huge? \n\nThe whole meal including water and chips and salsa set me back $10 bucks. I even have a small lunch for tomorrow. The chips are homemade and the thicker type. The red salsa was spicy but not hot and green was good. \n\nThe rest of the menu looked good, nothing stood out as a must have but I will be back. \n\nThe place was clean and they made a nice patio outside, complete with waterfall and everything.","5":"review","6":"C6IOtaaYdLIT5fWd7ZYIuA","7":"16","8":"19","9":"5"},{"0":"VY_tvNUCCXGXQeSvJl757Q","1":"2012-12-15","2":"31mOjx2g1F2xAVi20JQP1g","3":"4","4":"Good pizza.

They have everything a girly girl or a girly guy could possibly dream of and then some! They have all the best brands in cosmetics, skin care and perfume and they're always adding new items to their extensive product selection.  To me, getting a gift card to Sephora is like having Christmas morning over and over again.  Everywhere you look there are sparkly blushes, lip plumping glosses, lash-extending mascaras and anti-aging face creams- what more could anyone ask for? I can understand why men might hate going into Sephora- but they do have some products for guys too- although not many.  As far as I know, Scottsdale Fashion Square is home to the only Sephora in Scottsdale, but even as great as it is, it still can't beat the one right on the strip in Vegas.  They're open really late and you can shop with a drink in your hand- what could be better than that?","5":"review","6":"0CMz8YaO3f8xu4KqQgKb9Q","7":"0","8":"0","9":"4"},{"0":"yJr24Yy1K6bt2G9fX3_zPA","1":"2011-12-10","2":"T6x80EWBNGa6qzfCjSdMEg","3":"5","4":"I loved this little slice of heaven.

When I first hit AZ-88, it had an enormous deconstructed NY taxicab suspended from the ceiling which was a fantastical conversation piece. The wall behind the bar was completely covered in names and numbers. (I was far too proud when I accurately guessed that they were the names of cabbies and the numbers were their license numbers.) Overall, a very different, fun look.\n\nComfortable chairs and very full cocktails abound, and while they typically have a rock-steady delivery, more than a little cosmo has ended up in my friend's purse, to her chagrin. That aside, the food is fantastic and even though it's a bit hard to get out of here for under $30 per person (because you simply must try the cheesecake, and drinks are pushing $14), it's worth it as a classy-but-casual night out that you can really enjoy.\n\nThey have a great patio, the burger is dripping with flavor (and, in fact, cheese), and they have waffle fries with pretty much everything. Great salads and sandwiches help round things out, and they ship their cheesecake in from Carnegie Deli in New York which is just about the most perfect cheesecake you'll have the good chance to try. Forget that Cheesecake Factory nonsense, these people know how a cheesecake is done. It is rich, thick, with just a hint of sour, and an amazing flavor that takes your tongue hostage and demands whipped cream ransom.\n\nOverall, a wonderful place for drinks and good food with friends, and the staff is pointed but efficient and will throw back any shit you give them, in good humor or, as appropriate, not. (We've never run afoul of that rule, but you wouldn't want to, I assure you.)","5":"review","6":"8-2W5CmkDl9vrkxRpkiPRg","7":"1","8":"1","9":"1"},{"0":"Snp5LyDO9NeQiuFPOlkavw","1":"2012-01-09","2":"Ri6D23gr3_WqLgcZL6ttqg","3":"3","4":"Sugar bowl ice cream is yummy but what ice cream isn't? let's just say if one day I was craving ice cream, I wouldn't think of coming here specifically for theiiir tubs.

It may be that I'm spoiled by eating asian food in the Bay Area, but this place just didn't cut it. Unfortunately we both got red curry based dishes, so my experience was fairly limited... I got Duck w/red curry, and was not very impressed at all. The duck was tasty, but the curry was VERY bland. Honestly had I not been told it was curry, I wouldn't really have identified it as curry. The duck came with some plain steamed vegetables on the side, which as the meal went on, served to further water down my already bland curry sauce as the veggie water moved around on the plate. In addition to the curry lacking flavor, the vegetables really needed a boost as well. They should have been stir fried, or been served with a sauce of some sort. \n\nThe service was OK, but not great. There was only one other table in there, and the waitress seemed to forget things, and when we asked her about the meals, I felt like she was giving us canned answers of \"everything is good, just order something so I can go home\". Admittedly it was about 30 or 45 minutes before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it. \n\nIt wasn't a BAD meal by any means. It accomplished the goal of providing nourishment, and was better than bringing mickey D's back to the hotel room, but I won't be going back. The yelp definition of 2 stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\", and I think that description fits my meal perfectly.","5":"review","6":"-V3CXSxnUzjkLVqi1xGrkA","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"Exx5ffvnmk4MrTyCkPRuug","1":"2012-07-24","2":"2YfYYOjwd_yOHxEuv-9Sqg","3":"3","4":"Other then the chips and salsa (5 stars for salsa) the food is good, but not so much that I go out of my way to eat there. The fajitas are delish, with mushrooms and the meat always tender, but the price makes me cringe. At over $20 there are so many other places I rather eat. I usually opt for a cheese crisp with green onions and green chilies and a side of guacamole (which is always yummy but pricey) and I still pay for all that $15 plus what ever we are drinking.... I love the overly rustic atmosphere, but it really could use some updating and maybe a good scrub.... Some of the servers are not the friendliest, but these are mostly the family that work there and have been there forever, so don't take it personally....\nBut overall it is a Scottsdale landmark that is fun to bring out of towers to and the food is overall good.","5":"review","6":"BtQVxFotHFK3T2FtIrBWmg","7":"1","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"RqbSeoeqXTwts5pfhw7nJg","1":"2009-04-24","2":"gjtWdiEMMfoOTCfdd3hPmA","3":"4","4":"Man, if these guys were trying to replicate a gringo bar in Mexico down to every last detail, then they have it absolutely nailed. Sorry to ruin the mystery of the name. The building itself is a spectacle-- a brightly colored fusion of indoors and outdoors with a few different bars, games like the beanbag toss and televised sporting events in every direction, music blaring, a room dedicated to Elvis, and more Chuck Norris jokes than you can count plastered across the walls along with a bevy of posters advertising drink specials. A line of blue footprints painted across the concrete floor leads to the men's room, dollar signs to the ATM... genius stuff, really. It wouldn't have been at all out of place were they to have tried selling surfing monkey statues or trotting out a donkey painted like a zebra for an extra special photo opportunity.\n\nRumor had it that Dos Gringos had a killer Sunday brunch buffet and Bloody Mary bar, so we showed up at 10:30 AM to find... that they hadn't opened yet. A place that offers brunch but has the balls to wait until after 11 is okay in my book. Ten bucks gets you all-you-can-eat eggs, bacon, chile verde, beans, and a bunch of other stuff to tickle your fancy. There's nothing like sitting out in the sun, feeding a hangover and resuscitating last night's buzz before the clock strikes noon, and it sure beats sitting in traffic when that monstrosity of a church up the street unleashes some Old Testament fury on Alma School Road. Dos Gringos probably gets spring break wild on Friday night, but on Sunday morning, this place was just as tranquil as the doctor ordered.","5":"review","6":"dYtkphUrU7S2_bjif6k2uA","7":"2","8":"3","9":"3"},{"0":"I4bSn5gXsHuSPu7L-d_8nQ","1":"2012-12-04","2":"EI3YXHKCwAIrEj18OVNg-g","3":"5","4":"Fun, with caps if I did that sort of thing.

I'd found out about Mrs. White's by way of Lo-Lo's, and thought I'd try Mama's food before Son's.  It was good, I'll say that.  I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading.  Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat.  Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good.\n\nThe ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact \"Jesus\".  LOL.\n\nUnaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars.  Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin.\n\nAs a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable.  Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of \"what are YOU doing here?\" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.\n\nI'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.  I love small business and I'm proud of Mrs. White for making it this long; hope she continues for a long time to come.","5":"review","6":"e3LzMIrC6FtN9QeTvWiGag","7":"1","8":"1","9":"1"},{"0":"xmtKVO7C7KYVqMBe2eQq3A","1":"2009-05-07","2":"PQBYt2G58kn0tBMhK3x33Q","3":"4","4":"The food here is generally pretty good.

The pizzas are baked to order in a classic brick house oven. The toppings arent what youd find in your local Pizza Hut, either. You can choose from fresh slices of mozzarella, slices of perfectly seasoned italian sausage, pepperoni slices, salami slices, arugula, fresh basil leaves, tomatoes, etc. Basically what Im getting at, is this is beyond words delicious, classic LEGIT Italian pizza. Around the dining area, you will see freshly baked loaves of focaccia bread, that is later served to you with extra virgin olive oil for dipping once you are seated.

Both were excellent, though a little more in the line of American tastes -- not as spicy, and the pad si yew wasn't cooked slightly burnt like I recall it traditionally is made -- it was pretty tasty.\n\nThe hot tea was a great companion to my meal as well.\n\nThe service was great without being too pushy, invasive, or sloppy. They always refilled my water in a timely manner and didn't interrupt my conversation with my dad. That's important to me -- that servers don't bust into your conversation with little to no consideration of personal space.\n\nMy parents had been there several times and enjoyed it, so now I see why they liked it. Oh, and their spring rolls and the accompanying peanut and hot sauces were also delicious -- not the best I've ever had but super-tasty.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little dry (what is it with this word?

Try hanging out there between the hours of 11am and 1pm on a Friday afternoon and tell me you aren't entertained by some of the patrons who go in and out of the doors.

Park Central Starbucks. \n\nThe crew here is also super friendly every time I come in and they do their best to remember my name. It doesn't help that I tell them a different name every time. OK that's not true, but what a fun social experiment that would make.\n\nThe coffee... been there, done that and there's not much else I can say about it, but for the sport of people-watching, this a great place to hang out in the corner and just take it all in.","5":"review","6":"DJIwm4UCnM-SOxXbARjPsQ","7":"2","8":"2","9":"8"},{"0":"adKyTJT-RtaTP0krxLyQwQ","1":"2011-12-28","2":"5YVQIr0AJiiiJmkuhoRjzQ","3":"3","4":"nice location , good service but a little slow. been here twice so far and both times the food i would give 4 stars but both times they screwed up our orders and burger was cold, they did take off 20 percent for the issue and that was nice.. overall i enjoy the food and would go back.","5":"review","6":"fnO1oH3N5QMG-PvHA4F-VA","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"5zrVZnla81bH9eh76d5GVw","1":"2011-09-03","2":"6QNmh2tk6XK0jBrswJoARQ","3":"5","4":"I attended one of her classes for pressure cookers, and had to leave with one.

More love, though. \nThings I love: \nGreat wine, with all different price points, which is nice. Cool, speakeasy atmosphere. Great bands and entertainment. Great cheese platter and flat breads. Good prices. \nThings I do not love: \nService. Are you a bouncer? A bartender? Are you leading me to a seat? can you get me a seat? Its confusing. The staff is not clearly defined (not only do they not wear uniforms, or name tags, but they are scarce and hard to find) \nThe mix. It is kind of a random mix. I guess that can be a good thing, but I was there once and it was like Spring Break in Cabo, and then the other time, it was like 50+ snow birds day. Either one is fine, it is just hard to gage when to go and who to bring, like, my mom, or my pals. \nThey serve dessert, but no coffee. That, to me, is just strange. Buy a coffee maker. Sheesh. They have this amazing fondue that would be great with some baileys and coffee, and alas, no coffee. Strange. I know, \"wine bar\", but if you serve dessert, coffee should go hand in hand. \n\nIn the end, the place is cool and they have some of the best entertainment there. they ambiance is nice. Go early for a seat, they are hard to come by. Beware of paying $ at the door for an entertainment fee, but it is well worth it.","5":"review","6":"wxapwb1gulmqGVCNxVWjBQ","7":"0","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"R6aazv8FB-6BeanY3ag8kw","1":"2009-04-18","2":"EV7nE0i76PSf7Odfrqcicw","3":"4","4":"I have visited MacAlpine's a few times, and every time I have been very pleased with both the food and the service.

I am glad I did as upon entering I noticed they close close @ 7:30pm. When I came in all the tables were empty but they all had \"reserved\" place cards on them. Later I realized that there was some sort of club or church organization that came in and took over the restaurant so I would recommend making a reservation. The owner was very nice and sat us at one of the reserved tables. Her husband the chief quickly realized we knew nothing about polish food and offered us a sample of dill sour pickle soup. yummmmmy. \n\nThe restaurant itself is located in old town Glendale's Catlin court in a small quaint little house that gives you a more personal ambiance. The owners made us feel like we were literally dinner guest at their house which was not what I was expecting but a nice surprise. \n\nThe food is best described as \"home cooking\". The soup was excellent and my favorite part of the meal but the rest tasted just as my parents would have made growing up at home and I'm not Polish. Put simply all the main ingredients of my dish tasted as though they could have been bought at Fry's and my mom cooked them. The kielbasa was good but nothing unique, sauerkraut was tasty, but the green beans were either overcooked, thawed from frozen, or from a can. I am by no means a Polish food expert and maybe this is exactly how they would make it in Poland? \n\nOverall if you don't feel like cooking, want to try something new, and are in the mood for Polish food I would try it out and see for yourself. As for me I did like the restaurant and their owners but I think I will only return for the soup in the future, which I would gladly give 5 stars.","5":"review","6":"VyzwBKnq-LJ8OjvG0ZTwrg","7":"1","8":"1","9":"1"},{"0":"iDYzGVIF1TDWdjHNgNjCVw","1":"2012-05-06","2":"5vzkZR2B3TWcyrNkofEbEQ","3":"4","4":"This is my first dinner stop anytime I'm in Scottsdale, and always makes me look good when I recommend it.\n\nThis time, the standouts were the ceviche, the crab queso, the lamb adobo, and the  Cadillac marg.

The servers are surly kids, who have the audacity to tell you were you cannot stand, seemingly forgetting they work in the hospitality industry. If this were a city with a ton of good bars, that would never fly. But since they are one of the only games in the area, most people go back just out of convienence. The last time I was there, we coaxed a bum to dance to 1920's tunes that were being played out of the treehouse out front. That was about the only redeeming quality.

Absolutely. \n\nSadly, my table was near the entrance, limiting my ability to enjoy said view. Also, we are still in the summer months, so I was confused that there was a fire raging outside at night. \n\nThe decor is wonderful, dark with different tones and moods. We arrived in the early evening, so I was surprised to see how dark the room would eventually become. I didn't find the table and its decor that exciting, but it will give it a pass. Not everything has to be practical art.\n\nOur party consisted of five and we were certainly treated to a good sampling of what this place had to offer. Half of the party ordered off of the set price menu. This included a three course meal for something like fifty dollars. It may have even been less than that, but I'm not sure. This menu had an array of choices and wasn't limited to chicken or pork. \n\nI was impressed with the portions and the quality. The salads were crisp and the dressing wasn't overpowering, more of an accent, the way it should be. The meat was tender and flavorful; our table ordered the NY, Ribeye and Salmon. I do agree with others who said that the sides were a little small, but I do think they were worth the price. I know for sure the cream of corn was, as it was treated with green chili and a bit of spice. \n\nThe desert was alright. Not a great deal of variety. The textures were spot on, but the temperatures seems a bit off. If a dish was intended to be served warm, it was slightly too cold, etc.\n\nThe service was bad. Probably the worst service I've had at any restaurant. Our server left items off of the tab, forcing her to return and run the debit card three separate times. I am okay with someone making a mistake, but it should not take two attempts to correct. Also, my wife and I ordered Mojitos. They were very average. No sugar, which I assumed was standard fare for Mojiots, and amount of mint was rather low. I understand that drinks are open to a bartender's whim, so I won't dwell on this fact.\n\nValet had a bit of trouble with our car and keys, which was annoying.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience, food and atmosphere alike.

Im warning you now, dont ask how much longer after you put your name in if they told you how long when you checked in. \n\nAbout 10am is when it really got packed, just about when we got done. I ordered the chicken and waffles and i really liked it. I asked for some butter for my waffle because it didnt come with any and it made the dish perfect for me. The chicken had great flavor and when you take a bite with the waffle and butter and the syrup, heaven. I tried some bites without the butter and it wasnt even close to be the same for me. \nMy grandma got some omellete and she gave me some because she knew she wouldnt finish it and i would order that also. The omelletes are pretty good size but my wifes dish, my sons and mine where not that much food especially for $9. We are use to getting enough food for 2 when you eat at breakfast places and slighty cheaper. Not complaining because it was good but be ready. \nThere was 2 guys sitting next to use and trying to eat there 30 minute food challange. big ass egg plate with bacon and hash browns, they both only made thru about halfway.  I would definilty go back and get the same stuff. I also got a lemonade with mint and it was just right. My son really didnt like his reese's pancakes.\nId like to go back and try some of this stuff ham steak w/ gravy, chicken fried steak w/ hashbrowns, bannana pecan caramel french toast","5":"review","6":"3w-JiPus8k-BR5PQ7egDvQ","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"xWlCgISVtozxCztPA4nGaQ","1":"2010-05-21","2":"AUCwvenvFqnWcv04yYrL1Q","3":"2","4":"On a early Saturday evening, the band was playing the crowd was just starting to meander in.

As a hardcore Mexican food enthusiast I was intrigued by the concept but barely able to figure out how this fascinating dish was pronounced.  I am proud to say that I am a HUGE fan of pupusas now.  \n\nSalvadoreno popped up in a search of mine to find a low-key, nice Sunday night place to relax and enjoy some food.  It definitely was worth the visit to an interesting part of Mesa.\n\nThe restaurant is very similar to a lot of Mexican food restaurants anyone who has lived in Phoenix will be familiar with.  One room with several tables and a counter with interestingly-named dishes posted behind it.  The waitress was very friendly, but I will say that knowing a little Spanish helped.  My girlfriend and I both ordered the Pupusa combo platter, real risky based on other reviews - I know.  I went with Pollo and the revuelta mixed with pork, cheese and beans.  She had the chicken as well with carne asada.  This little dish is fantastic!  I think next time I'll just stick with getting two pupusas because I was extremely full and did NOT need to add rice and beans to the mix (although those were good too.)\n\nThe only disappointment was the fact that Independence Day was on the TV in Spanish, but the volume was too far down to hear.  I'd love to hear the voice-over actor for Will Smith busting out a \"Bienvenidos a Tierra, P***!\"\n\nOn a more serious note, I look forward to heading back here as soon as possible.  I'd love to try the Ceviche, as it's on the Best of Phoenix list, and there are a few other dishes (think breakfast) that looked intriguing.","5":"review","6":"mQba83gB018LlGt51r80ZQ","7":"1","8":"2","9":"1"},{"0":"qMkIbQFrROSnPaQ7at85-w","1":"2010-02-13","2":"lkW5sIbOqiYRQbkpera8dg","3":"4","4":"I agree with others that it seems a bit expensive at $15- but that still would not steer me away from going.\n\nFor the first time in about 8 years I found myself at the DBG with some out of town family.

Congrats, my lady.\n\nIf you can get past the chick-chosen wallpaper (wrong) and perfect-sphere fake tabletop plants from restoration, the different-height tables mix up the room just right and make it feels shabby chic without the white.\n\nSay hi to Joy. =)","5":"review","6":"hDlSSyDreM9xY4yQWPm54w","7":"1","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"9Y3aQAVITkEJYe5vLZr13w","1":"2012-04-09","2":"X_AT29hdvyK8omBxRsfasQ","3":"5","4":"We started each morning of our vacation at The Breakfast Club.

The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. \n\nSo then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour.  The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen.  I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. \n\nStill, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time.

Without you, I would have been stuck in Phoenix with no idea of where to find Thai food for lunch that was near a Light Rail station in Tempe!\n\nI arrived at Thai Rama about 11:15 AM.  On entering, there was no indication of waiting to be served and no one visible from the staff, so I selected a table and sat down.  My waitress came to the table and asked if I would be more comfortable at a 2-seat table instead of the 4-seat table I had selected.  Since there were about 25 available tables of various size, I declined and told her I was comfortable where I sat.  There were 3 other tables active in the restaurant, so I did not anticipate the restaurant needing my 4-top before I was done.\n\nThe waitress set the lunch specials menu on the table and went to get a glass of water.  The lunch specials menu had 10 options available, but no Som Tom.  I asked the waitress if Som Tom was available and she answered that she did not know what Som Tom was.  She reached for a full menu as I explained that Som Tom is green papaya salad.  She handed me the menu and directed me to the third page for salads.  There, first on the list, Som Tom.\n\nI ordered Som Tom, the yardstick by which I measure every Thai restaurant, 10 spicy (5 makes my nose run, 8 makes my forehead sweat and 10 brings tears to my eyes), leaving off the green beans and shrimp, and jasmine rice.  Waitress asked if I wanted anything else to drink, but I said I would stick with water.\n\nAmbience here is pretty plain...and the paper napkins are not of the highest quality.  The decor reminded me of a formula-type restaurant like an Applebees or Chili's...with a hispanic flair.  I observed the chef as he came out of the kitchen and made a loop around the dining room.  As he walked by, I asked in Thai how he was doing.  He stopped and replied that the day was starting off slow, but that it would be busy soon enough.  Then, he continued back on to the kitchen after wishing me a good day.\n\nAbout 5 minutes later, my papaya salad was brought to the table.  Portion size was nice, about 2 1/4 cups.  I took a taste and evaluated a 5 spicy.  When the waitress came to ask if I needed anything, I asked for more chili and lime.  She returned quickly with red chili pepper and sliced lime.  I doctored up the order and fell to with a gusto.  For the price, adequate.  \n\nJasmine rice was about a cup, and not too sticky.  The waitress was good about keeping my water glass full...and in Phoenix, that is important!\n\nOn completing my lunch, I sat and waited for the waitress to bring my bill.  I saw no one for about 10 minutes, then the chef came out of the kitchen and made another round of the dining room.  He asked me (in English) if I enjoyed my salad.  I answered in Thai that it was not spicy enough, and I was surprised he was using red chili instead of Thai chili.  He chuckled and replied that Thai chili was a little more expensive.  I asked for my check and he said he would send the waitress out.\n\nFor the convenience, outstanding!  For the next experience, I will be sure the chef sees me before I place my order.  For the wait on the bill, a little too long.","5":"review","6":"8qe2c5uRlAkvNFvDriBm1Q","7":"0","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"8oxnPoOS5wQzhl5LLOm7ow","1":"2010-07-25","2":"DCCqJzKnPARsxymujSUkAA","3":"5","4":"Awesome country club.

It seemed to be normal Miso soup with some shredded cabbage tossed in.  The cabbage added a texture that I didn't really want but it was easy to eat around it.\n\nThe presentation of the sashimi was interesting.

I'm a freak for Chili burgers (good ones are very difficult to find) and The Lobby's Chili burger was fairly dull, featured Cinci style Chili (BLAH) and like. some sort of cheese whiz kinda crap.  Boo. Also ordered fries, and a Chicago dog.. the Chicago dog was overpriced and forgettable, and the crinkle cut fries were reminiscent of Del Taco's.. which isn't exactly a bad thing, but considering that Lobby's is supposed to be a tasty, quality burger place, frozen crinkle fries are kind of a half assed approach.. ALSO the amount of salt on the fries was enough to invoke a stroke! :x  Finally whoever dude was that handed me my bag of food was all like ZIPPY DOO I GAVE YOU A CUP OF FRENCH FRY SAUCE.. There were two orders of fries.. one cup of sauce.. which was just basic secret sauce.. not super great... secret sauce, to boot..

We asked the waitress a general question about a beer and she made something up that was ridiculously wrong.  Okay, she doesn't know beer.  We liked the chips & salsa, it was a good start, then I took a sip of my water.  What the?  I know what Tempe tap water tastes like, but this was weird.  The aftertaste made me cringe, I couldn't drink it, even with a slice of lemon in it, maybe it was the ice.  Hubby ordered chicken enchiladas, which he orders practically everywhere, and it was so bad he didn't finish it.  My meal was not memorable either.  I wanted to love this place, or at least like it.

Does that make me the most knowledgeable person on the venue? By all means, no. But, there are some very common themes among the shows I've seen here, even though the artists were different genres, different, crowds, and even different times of year. \n\nThe sound quality is terrible. The last three bands that I have seen there (and have seen in other venues as well) all complained that they couldn't get the sound right on their monitors or in the house. To me, that's a major turn off, if the band isn't happy with their sound, are they going to be very motivated to play? Maybe it's a slighted observation, but it seems that the only bands that return to this venue, are the ones that play music, where the sound quality isn't...let's say \"sacrificed or as important\" (metal, hardcore, thrasher, hip-hop, whatever you call it). \n\nThe venue is also hot. I don't read the reviews of others, before I review a location, because I don't want my opinions to be skewed, but I noticed someone said, \"don't wear pants,\" honestly, that's a really good tip. The last show I saw here was in June. I know, it's Phoenix, in the summer, suck it up. But when you exit the venue and it is noticeably and significantly \"cooler\" than inside the venue, we've got issues, can they not afford to run the a/c? \n\nThe answer to that question is, maybe not. The bar is understaffed, and patrons seem to be lined up 3+ deep, all around. Sometimes you've got to spend money to make money. Hire more bartenders, customers get served faster, thus allowing them more time to consume the beverage and purchase more. That means you can sell more, which means you will make more money! What a concept. \n\nHate to just destroy a business, but hopefully they will heed the feedback constructively. Until then, remember: if you've always wanted to hear the artist you are going to see in a low-fi format, here's your chance, if you have always wanted to forgo wearing those pantaloons, I support you, and finally, you should craft a clever way to hide a flask, since you won't get served, although this might be difficult sans bottoms.","5":"review","6":"80PHOfM8KOBb7xEQN4C0lg","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"TbaAnzOTX2-boTbAp3e8Qw","1":"2008-07-14","2":"nOksR3WGXn8iuZwTyUX9qw","3":"3","4":"I liked the tortillas:  handmade, rich and salty.

I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and I'm sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  \nWhen paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor.","5":"review","6":"OpUXG69nP4YjlEZDlkdVcQ","7":"0","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"QIHyWCBG3ftvXbGdHQKdHw","1":"2012-12-29","2":"Dv9iSQe9s_kn5uuhy0iM_w","3":"1","4":"Not that any SBUX is worth going out of your way for, but this one is worth skipping.

I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.\n\nWine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra.

Passed it many times, just didn't catch my eye enough for me to remember it on those nights when I desperately try to think of some new place to try.\n\nI've since been here twice (over about a 3 month time span), and I really love it.  First time, had great food (all server recommendations - although he disappeared prior to arrival of meal, seemed to be doing side work so he could bolt out).  Great although somewhat minimal service for the second half of our dinner, former waiter did not say he was leaving, we sat for a little while before someone new arrived.  Ambiance and company made it barely noticeable.   Personally, I don't care as long as I get good service.  We're not family, I don't need an apology or heartfelt goodbye.  The garlic app - what it is called? - your server will know, it's probably their most popular dish, it is AMAZING.  Order this unless you hate garlic or are on a diet.  I consider myself a good cook, but I would leave this up to Richardsons.  As I write this I realize the whole reason for my review is that dish, because I don't remember anything else I had.  Stopped by for drinks the second time, ended up ordering a pizza, expected little since it didn't mesh with the menu, it was really quite good.  Bartender was great (I think he was actually the take-over waiter from my previous visit).  Very cozy place, if you come later or are are willing to wait, you can get a private table in a cave like nook.  The place is not cheap, comparative to other finer dining establishments.

They're both fine.\n\nWe visited this one, near Chandler mall, for lunch.  We ordered off the lunch menu.  My wife and I both had the brisket sandwich.  I had the Wilbur beans, she had fries.  It was fine.  Not great, but OK.\n\nThe brisket meat itself did not seem to be smoked.  At all.  Meat has a certain look and taste when it has been smoked, and this just didn't have it.  Frankly, the meat seemed sorta pale...as if it had been boiled instead of grilled or smoked.  And either the meat or the sauce was excessively salty.  It wasn't severe (or I would have returned it), but it was noticeable.  Salt should enhance flavor, not stand out as a major flavor.\n\nAnd a note about the sauce.  I examined one of their 'for sale' bottles (you can buy their sauce to take home).  Did they use molasses or brown sugar, as most self-respecting BBQ chefs would?  No.  High fructose corn syrup.  Yuck.  Besides that stuff being poison to your pancreas, it's just \"not right\".  That's not how BBQ is done.\n\nAnyway, Famous Dave's is really nothing special.  The BBQ is \"OK\", but not very authentic.  Given the choice I would take Joe's, hands-down.  But if you want some BBQ, and are nowhere near Joe's, this will do.  Beats the heck out of Tom's BBQ, that's for sure (see my review of Tom's...truly awful).

On my way to the store I realized my stomach was growling. Never a good idea to shop on an empty stomach. A while back in The Savvy Shopper rag in the China Grill ad was a little banner about Wok n Stix being a new location. And because of an event that fell apart this week I had a bug to eat something Asian. So I found it and stopped in.\n\nChinese fast food. They also have hamburgers and a few other things. I stuck with something I figured I would like, orange chicken ($7.95). It came reasonably quick, was too hot to eat right away. Most of my Chinese fast food consists of Panda Express and Ming Gee. This was much better, in addition to the onions and bell peppers listed mine had mushrooms, celery, sprouts and some other stuff. Service was on styrofoam with plastic utensils. Even though I was eating in the rice came in a take out box which I thought was sorta weird. I still hate eating out alone but at least I wasn't the only person in the place. Each side of the place had a long upholstered bench with tables and chairs that could be slid along to make up different seating and two tables in the middle.\n\nThere was nobody being served at the front counter when I was finished so I stopped,picked up a menu and talked to the woman there and found out she is an owner. They have had the place for 6 months and are the same family that owns China Grill not far away.","5":"review","6":"Ps1Db9zOatoF_76FZNO5CQ","7":"0","8":"3","9":"0"},{"0":"13lNc7KSuVHBrUybTR23qw","1":"2012-01-20","2":"3eY_MfLha0Sbv4B2IXpqVw","3":"4","4":"Excellent selection of unusual but delicious pizzas.  my favorite so far include prosciutto pizza and the lamb pizza","5":"review","6":"yov4PgFnEIOimzKdU2wV0g","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"O-Xa9GCFWI65YiBD5Jw_hA","1":"2009-10-29","2":"nlQUxEm_5GouQdmgG8GXVA","3":"5","4":"What an unbelievable night we had at Mastro's City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? It's a very welcome change.\n\nIt's dark, it's sexy, and it's probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. \n\nThe seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat I've had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. I'm not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal it's so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. \n\nThe only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter don't worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on it's own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing.","5":"review","6":"JgDkCER12uiv4lbpmkZ9VA","7":"1","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"ViLOy7fr21PIVGEzYPyK4w","1":"2012-08-12","2":"RPpt_W8DSEpahyXxeRhVrA","3":"2","4":"I went here with a friend to use a Groupon for a gel manicure and a spa pedicure. I knew it was a school going into the appointment. My issues with the place are as follows:\n1. The students there were very unprofessional. They talked about their personal lives, talked to each other, and just were generally inappropriate for a business setting. Their supervisor overheard everything and did not say anything. This is pretty disturbing since some of these girls stated that they were going to work at places like Dolce in a few weeks. \n2. The gel manicure was billed as 'unchippable' by the people at this salon, but my friend had one whole nail peel off the day after the manicure and my nails chipped 2 days after. This is especially annoying because it is difficult to remove the polish that remained on my nails, so they just look bad. \n3. The massage was pretty weak. \n4. They don't have enough carts for pedicures, so I had to put my foot up on my 'pedicurist's' lap...that's a bit odd. \n5. It was difficult to make an appointment here. I had to call several times and leave messages and wait for them to call me back. \n\n\nOverall, I would not return to this place, even at the cheap price. I guess you get what you pay for.","5":"review","6":"3gIfcQq5KxAegwCPXc83cQ","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"-EctXOb3B7T177jGYUhjVA","1":"2012-03-05","2":"WrYEb2x-JkLZLfLimP5csg","3":"3","4":"The beer list here is GREAT.

When we arrived between 730 and 8 on a Saturday morning, there were about four, maybe five firetrucks in the parking area...these rescue/aid teams just camp out there, I think, because of all the doofuses who don't plan accordingly waterwise or overestimate their ability to make this climb.  Also, two different areas of the Echo Canyon trail are especially steep and potentially slick, so they've installed some metal railings to help you along there...but only if you've got some gloves or if the temperature is moderate (uhhhh,...that doesn't really happen in Phoenix during the day in summer), because those damn things get hot enough to fry an egg.  Also - water, water, water.  Bring a LOT, or top off at the start of the trail before you go up (though the water out of that tap attached to the water fountain is about 85 degrees, yuk). \n\nIt was a fun jaunt.

Hopefully, I'll make it to others...but if I could only get to the Camelback Inn, I'd be in heaven. Here's the rundown of how I enjoy the place: Early morning appointment for massage - Rose does fantastic hot stone - I like her the best. Then I shower and get into the eucalyptus steam room. Next I head out to the pool and savor the view of Camelback Mountain and the amazing desert landscaping they've procured. I drink some water and as I lounge there, I order a small, healthy and very tasty meal (usually breakfast). I swim a little, lounge a lot - regardless of the time of year.  If I have planned it, I then head back into the showers and clean up for my next treatment. I spend hours there and if I feel like I might be pressed for time, I reschedule.","5":"review","6":"msgAEWFbD4df0EvyOR3TnQ","7":"1","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"3n9mSKySEv3G03YjcU-YOQ","1":"2012-06-01","2":"9V5XGfH54FWON5zkK6SpSg","3":"3","4":"Bad service, great food, awful coffee.","5":"review","6":"1r7dSiDim_U0GFn8V4HvAQ","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"jsJxRLGm8zjWm_HVR2FDnw","1":"2011-07-24","2":"RriK-Hb3PGwroO7Zfnd8pw","3":"2","4":"I'm usually a big fan of dive bars but wasn't impressed, at all.

This place happens to be just across the street from my work and the reviews on here were a vote of confidence. \n\nI had the cherry blossom roll and rainbow roll, shared edamame, and hot green tea. The cherry blossom roll was good, not amazing, but good. The fish was fresh enough, and I did like the eel sauce drizzled on it. The rainbow roll was much less rainbow than I'm used to. The rainbow roll did have a bit of a fishy taste, and the whitefish on it was a pale yellowish brown color, and not as moist as it could have been. The crumbled macadamia nuts were and interesting and kind of fun garnish. The edamame was tasty, not over cooked, but could have used a little more salt. The green tea was boiling hot, with the kind of walnutty aftertaste you get from good green tea, I was disappointed it came in a single glass, not in a tea pot diffuser with a teacup like at most restaurants.\n\nMy girlfriend had pork katsu, the sauce drizzled on it was sweet and vinegary, but not too overwhelming. Gauging from the fact that she ate all of it I would assume it was pretty good. The salad that came with it was a bit strange, iceberg lettuce and a cream sesame dressing. The miso soup on the side was better than the little packets I get at the store, but didn't taste home made. It was not too salty, but the tofu must have been dehydrated, it was in tiny little shriveled squares on the bottom of the bowl. \n\nThe waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. It wasn't too busy when we went, about 5pm. The music was typical pop music, but thankfully unlike some places (RA for instance) its not blaring. \n\nI would say its definately not the best sushi I've ever had, not even the best I've had in arizona, but it was ok. The rainbow rolls at kobe are better.","5":"review","6":"K46kUag6aS0Vd4JjiaqNsQ","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"XHr5mXFgobOHoxbPJxmYdg","1":"2010-10-31","2":"E-EAo8WSdyBTUDMVaMn3uA","3":"3","4":"Meh.\n\nPlus for cool decor.

While this may be a hot-spot for hotel guests, I think that locals might be missing out on its charm. \n\nI am a huge fan of anything the Camelback Inn does, especially since they offer live music and a great space for relaxation and Rita's Kitchen is no exception. This restaurant is airy and opens up to the spacious Camelback Inn patio where they play live music every night. \n\nBreakfast: \n\nBreakfast at Rita's is sublime and pretty reasonably priced. They offer a breakfast buffet for around $23 which includes eggs made to order (including omelets), pancakes, waffles, pastries, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage and hashbrowns. It's a great pick for a leisurely weekend breakfast. Just today was Mother's Day and while we only did the breakfast buffet, I did catch a glimpse of the Mother's Day brunch and holy moly do they know how to wow a crowd! Not only did they have stations set up all throughout the restaurant, patio and R-Bar, but they also had an extensive dessert area with build-your-own sundaes, freshly made cotton candy (in an old fashioned cotton candy maker) and a long dessert table with a chocolate fountain. \n\nLunch:\n\nLunch here is sublime and I also enjoy either the tacos or the chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich is particularly a favorite of mine due to the cheese and sauce. The fries are tasty as well and you can either get sweet potato or regular. I also get sweet potato then regret not just getting the regular which are better in my mind. If the weather permits, sit on the patio and enjoy the beautiful water fountains, views of the mountain and tropical/desert setting.","5":"review","6":"4ozupHULqGyO42s3zNUzOQ","7":"3","8":"7","9":"2"},{"0":"8cL7aJVKTYmLguzXEAS3Lw","1":"2011-09-09","2":"-GIRAMumwpwkJ790HOd9KQ","3":"5","4":"We happened upon this location when meeting a friend for dinner.

But that's a good thing. The restaurant would qualify as a \"Dive\" in most circles, a tiny 20 seat affair with recycled refer units as cabinets located in the corner of a strip mall with a 99 cent store and a BigLots. Not exactly a high-end neighborhood.\n\nBut after having heard of this little cafe in The New Times and finding that Phoenix Magazine rated their Ceviche and Shrimp salad as one of the Valley's top 50 dishes, we decided that we must give it a try! The article in New Times raved about something called a Pupusa and description sounded familiar, once we were there I realized why.\n\nEvery culture on earth seems to have developed some form of stuffed hand pie. You know the formula, a regional bread or pastry dough, formed into a pocket and stuffed with savory or sweet fillings. Food on the go. Well in El Salvador it's called a Pupusa, and they were delicious!\n\nA kind of thick corn tortilla type bread, filled with several different types of  fillings, pork and cheese, beans, chicken and cheese, beef and cheese or beef, bean and cheese.\n\nNow this is NOT your typical Arizona/Mexican food. The cheese is a freshly made cheese that is a Salvadoran tradition and is one of the best fresh cheeses I have ever had, smooth and soft yet very flavourful. The tortilla is not what you might be used to either, they are corn tortillas but they are not the course chip like corn tortillas so prevalent in Americanized Hispanic foods. They are thick, soft and delicious. It is this tortilla that is the basis of their Pupusas.\n\nDon't expect to find the standard \"Mexican Restaurant\" re-fried beans here either. Spicy, flavourful and smooth, having been mashed right after cooking, they are among the best example of simple yet wonderful tastes you will experience here.\n\nWe had some of all of the different Pupusas offered on the menu which are priced very reasonable indeed, and were impressed with all of them, though the pork and cheese and the bean were my personal favorites.\n\nWe also had a corn tamale that was sweet and moist and tasty, rolled in a banana leaf instead of the corn husk we are used to. Perhaps that is why it was so much more moist than your average corn tamale.\n\nTo finish off our repast we enjoyed the fried plantains, actually an appetizer on the menu, they were crispy on the outside and starchy and tasty inside. Served with freshly made salsa and the Salvadoran version of Crème Fraîche that was also a hit.\n\nThe owner was our server and I am still not sure she spoke much English, but she was very nice to us and the orders were always right. As well as very very hot! I had to let my Pupusas sit a few minutes before they were cool enough to consume, and a word of warning, Plantains retain heat even better than potatoes do so proceed carefully.\n\nAs I've said the Ceviche and Shrimp salad is an award winner and the Carne Asada that the folks at the next table had ordered looked delicious. However I could not ask their opinion as they did not seem to speak English either and my Spanish is worse than terrible. But they seemed to be enjoying it, I'll give it a try next time.\n\nThey serve breakfast too and I can hardly wait to give that a try as well.\n\nStop in, you'll be glad you did.","5":"review","6":"WmldRvl1nKxuKM6weiO6fQ","7":"2","8":"3","9":"1"},{"0":"KwGQqUCpHHhOhVqyOL2QTA","1":"2007-08-08","2":"bnHBeO3MIyG_yduDiN-XpA","3":"3","4":"While Scottsdale's Jackrabbit Supper Club is Britney Spears-approved -- the pop singer made the rounds last December when she reportedly made out with Arizona Cardinals hottie Matt Leinart -- it's a little too clubby for my taste.

I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!\n\nI went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!\n\nI ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!\n\nWe also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!\n\nFor my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was \"stuffed.\" Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion. \n\nWe definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.\n\nThe atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people \"off\" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.\n\nWe would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out. So... don't sit under the lights, if you can help it!","5":"review","6":"YgucNL2tibnjEmDLqHPqow","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"0ONypOKIhttBz9IJzBE8jg","1":"2010-09-24","2":"r36zYGVScZB1r49kqvllFw","3":"5","4":"flemings is always top notch. we went for the thursday night wine tasting 20 wines for $25 introducing there new 100 wines by the glass.

We simultaneously stab into it with our forks, take a bite, and we look at each other like the first time we fell in love. The combination of the salmon, bacon and sautéed greens was out of this world. Coupled with the bread pudding and sweet tomato concoction put me over the top. \n\nWe let the waitress know what we experienced and to thank the chef.

He proceeded to tell us what he had planned for tomorrow's dinner menu and we made reservations on the spot for tomorrow night. \n\nI never knew food could profoundly affect your mood but I was driving home singing my heart out to my iPod.

They're bruthas, you see, and hadn't hung out in awhile.  We had MLK day off together and spend the afternoon together.

This is a perfect day-drinking place when the weather is nice, and they do a good job of creating a large indoor / outdoor space with plenty of patio. Happy Hour is pretty great - 1/2 off almost all beers. (they do well drink / wine specials too, but don't remember what they were. I think it was $1 off... but don't quote me on that.) Bottom line, I had 3 Firestone DBAs, and i think my bill was about 8 bucks before tip. Score. (normal beer prices are in the $5-6 range. A vodka gimlet not on happy hour (well vodka) cost me $4, which is right where it should be.)\n\nAlso made a return trip on a Saturday night, to get a feel for the weekend crowd. Not too bad, but mildly disappointed.

It stinks like the rotting dead animal it is. It is definitely bad.\n\nAnd it gets even worse! As I inspected it and opened up the two breasts (Whole Foods puts two breast together with a net to make one large one), I pulled out about 8 inches of thick, fatty, I don't even know what from it.

What ever that stuff is, it is all gray and rotten.\n\nThey are basically stuffing their Turkey Breasts with junk to make more money. I have had it with them! \n\nI am not surprised.

However, several choices are available.\n\nThis is a nice mall to just wander and shop, and eat and drink, and enjoy whatever is going on.","5":"review","6":"Mb0psF4WQF7gZSuZafVr-g","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"Pr9rQKypHgC_J1AfufxzIw","1":"2011-08-12","2":"6ka2jUMJLx9ti2kRZh05yQ","3":"5","4":"Once again Wildflower proves why it's my favorite breakfast hangout! Jeff the Manager on staff today rocks! \n\nSome of us hangout at a restaurant to make it a working meal...and sometimes, during that time Nature calls...so I asked the busboy to not clear my table as I needed to step away for a moment and he cheerfully agreed. I came back to find my table cleared by new patrons who had taken it upon themselves to steal my table (I guess the fact that the food was only half eaten, and the water and coffee were still half filled were no clue). The busboy was upset that he'd turned his back for just a moment and Jeff came to the rescue...after apologizing to me and finding the perfect way to make it right, he vowed to let the new people know that they were rather um 'overly proactive' in clearing the table themselves and that he had some people who regularly relaxed and worked in the restaurant and do step away.\n\nHe handled the situation with me just right and I am sure that those people that took my table were made to gently understand that they need to ask before taking an uncleared table.\n\nKudos to Jeff and the staff for making me so happy I had to tell everyone here...and to the couple who took my table, if you are reading this...did you REALLY need that booth? I mean, when I came out of the can there were like, I dunno, 5 empty tables...seriously? Like, did you propose there or something????","5":"review","6":"3PleJJEDyGLIWqaW7JlTyQ","7":"1","8":"1","9":"2"},{"0":"bO2rQLEntQLcg675LjEqaA","1":"2009-04-03","2":"OBRGsiB-FjLoZewGXtEQ5A","3":"3","4":"Came here for lunch recently with active Yelper and friend Brett B. I'm sure he'll post up his own review of the place.\n\nThis is the kind of place you walk up to the register and place your order, then take a plastic number to your table and the server brings you your food. You also get your glass and go fill 'er up at the fountain yourself. I wasn't sure what to expect, but felt good vibes the minute I asked \"how big is the salad\" and the guy at the register walked into the kitchen to bring me a dish to show me. That was nice and above my expectation, as most places the servers will make a \"size\" with their hands and shrug and say, \"i don't know... about like this?\" So, yeah. I like that this guy actually showed me a plate and made a \"mound\" with his hand to show me some kind of size of the salad. \n\nWhen I ordered \"just water\" he went to give me a plastic cup with a lid, and then said, \"you know what? Just take a regular glass, it's more comfortable....\" He trusted me not to fill up my glass with anything but water (and I did only drink water). That was nice, and made me feel like an adult. Not like at some places (much cheaper than this place) that give you a plastic cup like the ones you pee in at the doctor's office, when you order water.\n\nI really enjoyed my lunch here - Had a chicken caesar salad (one of my favorite things to order pretty much anywhere i go because I'll never make it at home), along with a cheese pizza.\n\nThe caesar salad - for those who have a love affair with this meal - was \"perfect\" . The portion was generous, and it was chopped and tossed. The chicken was shredded and mixed in with the salad, which makes SUCH a difference in getting an even distribution, and reducing pain-in-the-ass-ness of having to cut up a chicken breast atop a salad with oversized utensils like at so many other places. It was perfectly dressed too - not too heavy, just right. And the parmesan cheese was shaved over it, rather than shredded or grated. Nice touch. Excellent flavor, every mouthful.\n\nThe cheese pizza was a cripsy, ultra thin crust, delicious red sauce (kinda sweet, in a good way), and the cheeses were mozzarella and fontina - the saltiness mixed really well with the sweetness of the sauce and made this simple pizza taste extraordinary.\n\nGranted, having had some beyond-extraordinary pizza in new york, I'm spoiled and have to say it was not as good as my favorite thin crust pizza from Totonno's in NYC's upper east side. But still, darn good. I'd eat it again. (I took some home and it didn't look like it heated up well later on when my husband was having it).\n\nBrett had the tomato, gorgonzola, chicken, salad on mixed greens. I think it had pine nuts too. I got to taste it and it was even more flavorful than mine. Either one of these would be an excellent choice for those of you who like to order salads. Delicious. \n\nAnd the service was great! The  manager even came by our tables to refill our glasses for us, though the drinks were self-serve from a fountain. the place was not busy when we got there, but it picked up as we were finishing our meals. \n\nGreat food - great service - great vibe. I hope this place sticks around. \n\nDefinitely would eat there again. Looking forward to it, even!","5":"review","6":"KICFDhBX25ruK_iW6gLgTA","7":"1","8":"3","9":"0"},{"0":"hb9EA0McsItsYi_FvoWFIA","1":"2012-06-30","2":"7WdxVKa6S08FyP5Chz1c4Q","3":"5","4":"There are no words to express the value of the quality of service that you receive from  Tina Yragui's Hands 4 Healing  therapeutic overall body care.

Our server kept calling me honey.. and seemed to be in such a hurry she wouldn't stop and listen to me. You know how needy I can get and need to be listened too and heard. We started by ordering the Baked Spinach and Artichoke Dip..  what I couldn't understand is 1, how did the chef let this go out and 2, no one but us could smell the scorched burnt smoke coming off the dish. This thing was so badly burned and scorched it was completely inedible. Sent it back and she didn't even offer to bring another one. Perhaps it was because they were so busy they just wanted the food to go out?\n\nSo I ordered their Famous BBQ Ribs.. I hate complaining to much but these were old ribs.. maybe maybe a day or 2 before.. pork takes on a funky taste when its fridged for to long.. the texture of the meat (when you could find any) was like jerky. I happily ate my Creamed Spinach (2 star yummy) and didn't eat more then 2 bones of the ribs. When the waitress came to clear the plates (she never checked on us) she asked if I was full. I told her that the ribs weren't to my liking.. she smiled and asked if I wanted dessert. \n\nOver all I would never come back to Don and Charlie's.. aside from the  Creamed Spinach, which I can make myself, there weren't many redeeming qualities. A shame too because it's so close to the house. I don't get it because the Yelps are so good. Maybe they were having  a bad night? It was so bad I wouldn't ever go back to find out.","5":"review","6":"lPaYMDmJbAnv_3pmZH_inw","7":"4","8":"10","9":"1"},{"0":"soiGohHtWOltGeomkSxzEw","1":"2012-03-29","2":"zMuTMydgOXEXA7ycogchyA","3":"1","4":"If there was a way I could give this restaurant NO stars, I might have.

My husband ordered a green chile dish and it came smothered in red sauce, when he asked the waiter if it looked green or red, the server said, \"nope that's what green looks like\".

I also enjoy the humbolt, which is very similar, and the majic mushroom with sliced portabella mushrooms, teriyaki glaze, green bell peppers, pineapple and pepper jack cheese. The 8inch is soo big but makes a great and filling lunch. You can't beat the prices either. Get the garlic herb bread, it is the best. The only thing I do not like about this place is that the whole \"marijuana\" theme can get old and annoying. This location can also get really really busy and the sandwiches take time to make.

(I found a great deal on LocalDines.com -use ref # 102729 if you sign up! Also, checking in with FourSquare got a us a deal! ) \n\nWe ended up going a little later (8ish) so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller. The bartender was very friendly, our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice.\n\nWe both had wine, the \"single glass\" serving is actually 2 glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for $20 or just buying a glass for $6.  I recommend the Falling Star Cab, it was full bodied and very yummy. The other wine we tried was the Hob Nob Pinot Noir. It was great, it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it. (I am not very good with wine lingo, but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me.)\n\nNeither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back. We got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on FourSquare (POWER NERD! I know.) I really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread. For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!\n\nWe also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. \n\nI will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. \n\nThere are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu. Their menu also boasts that everything, except for 9 or 10 items, is completely Gluten free.\n\nGood experience, definitely looking forward to trying it again for a full meal.","5":"review","6":"hTKFGpi3ltCV4B-XDFRT-A","7":"1","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"kJFS_3WlP6TFdNUYt6V6FA","1":"2011-08-09","2":"N_oaJQezhQb5EeK6lzwe3A","3":"2","4":"An interesting concept that didn't end up being what I hoped for.  \n\nI was pretty excited to try the Posh Noodles & Noshes Japanese street food as prepared by Josh Hebert.  I love Japanese food and was looking forward to the dishes that are not readily available in Phoenix.  Unfortunately I was underwhelmed by both the venue and the food.\n\nThe location inside the Lexington Hotel has definitely seen better days.  An attempt has been made to create a temporary generic space with chalkboard walls and butcher paper topped tables.  However, it came across as worn and dingy.\n\nOur waitress was not familiar with the menu or drink offerings ('I didn't work here last night') but was friendly and did find out answers from other staff.  Foolishly thinking that we would love each and every dish and take home a lot to enjoy the next day, we tried a large assortment.  An expensive mistake.\n\nDuck Gyoza w/ Ponzu - I prefer steamed gyoza over the fried presentation here.  Also, these had the tiniest, greasy portion of filling I have ever seen.\n\nHomemade Tofu w/ Ginger, Scallion, Cherry Blossom - this was good, with a sweet, dessert-like flavor but a somewhat runny texture.\n\nOkonomiyaki - this 'Japanese pizza' was among the better items.  However, the texture of the ingredients was strange - i.e. full slices of bacon rather than smaller bite-sized pieces made greasier than it needed to be and messy to eat\n\nTako Yaki - again, a strange texture with awkward large chunks of octopus surrounded by 'breading' that fell apart easily\n\nThe ramen dishes (Miso Ramen w/ Pork, Goma Ramen w/ Pork and Shitake Mushroom Rames) were small, and more or less indistinguishable from one another.   We left most of them behind, deciding not to take anything with us.\n\nThe dessert, Green Tea Pot de Crème was a nice finish but did not make me feel better overall about the $100+ meal.","5":"review","6":"n9Zg0jlOGtxfIrvoPm6Hhw","7":"4","8":"6","9":"3"},{"0":"4xLRmAD8QeqbN7Q7xTbmYg","1":"2011-06-16","2":"m3Tz7zfvsK7MAkwOafA6XQ","3":"2","4":"I love Victoria's Secret, but this store has a terrible selection, and the employees are rude here.

I also thought that there selection of PINK merchandise was severely lacking.","5":"review","6":"DsoD6Nyv4n4gQpjIq_y5DA","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"lTgbj26dpv8Ltzbf83T6oQ","1":"2012-03-10","2":"JkNadCNcsQLnK9SRjDPvSw","3":"5","4":"I found Cake Frenzy through an service listing on Craigslist while looking for someone to create our wedding cake/cupcakes. Not only were we on a tight budget we only had about 2 1/2 months to plan for the venue we wanted only had a few dates available. I met Jennifer about a month prior, my fiance' and I knew we wanted a peanut butter & jelly cake and she happily obliged. I emailed her a picture of what I wanted and the day of our wedding when I first saw our cake I almost cried. She went above and beyond my expectations. The cake was beautiful with sugar flowers and gelatin butterflies. All of our guests loved the flavor combinations and the decorations. I highly recommend Cake Frenzy, she is professional, she takes pride in her work and extremely reasonable.","5":"review","6":"Ksu2OeDaXiHurIX8gUHmkQ","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"DE8UVNCCpOE0vTAbGaMoeQ","1":"2011-08-20","2":"xojz72lSkjuhZylKIeSDRA","3":"5","4":"Love it.\n\nLast night I dropped into Romanelli's for the first time after driving past a time or two.  Glad I did.\n\nIt's a bakery and deli that offers a fine selections of meats, cheeses and breads.  They also sell all things culinary Italia.  \n\nWhen I stopped in it was 30-40 minutes to close.  I went directly to the deli counter for a sub and was met with a challenge as I decided which to try.  I opted for George's Special (ham, capicolla, salami, mortadella, pepperoni, provolone and hot peppers).  Given the close proximity to closing time I was expecting a sub on older bread that had been sitting around all day but it was still soft and very fresh.  The sub is easily the best I've had.  Amazing.\n\nI also purchased a cannoli.  I'm picky about these things.  Too many places fill 'em and stock 'em and the filling makes the shell soggy.  Romanelli's fills them upon order just like the Italian bakery near a friends house in Newark, NJ (until last night the best cannoli I've had).  The cannoli was top notch.  Simply the best.\n\nRight here in Phoenix, on one night, I had one of the best meals ever.  I cannot wait to return.  I only open they were open past 6pm.","5":"review","6":"gg_OKjOAl_vVmdh5ZETuiw","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"_w2wIsBh-1M1ZCed2KjLlw","1":"2011-11-03","2":"TrPutW46q_oVN6xScoZM7Q","3":"4","4":"I have been coming here for the past 4 years; the pizza and food are great.

Popped in here on opening night, and was pleasantly surprised. Hubby and I split the Mussaman, a hearty portion of curried veggies and short-ribs, and the Garlic Veggies with tofu. The Mussaman was by far the star, and given it's $16 entree price it needed to be. I see a lot of promise here, though I do find the prices to be rather high for this neighborhood. I should hope once they get their liquor license (expected sometime in January according to the waitress) that the food prices will come down. I'm not holding my breath on this one, however, since the moniker \"Modern Thai\" has become euphemism for \"Expensive Thai.\" I look forward to trying SaBai again after they've had some time to coalesce.","5":"review","6":"g2mozOU_F1nzpjLDY4CfzQ","7":"1","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"mKtHJOe1rtf-zGewKpAqrw","1":"2012-10-23","2":"i4kZYaGypxV6LPCroMK5-A","3":"1","4":"One stop has one goal and that is to get the $80. diagnosis fee and split.

So not complaining though, because it means I don't have to drive to the middle of nowhere to enjoy their old-timey newspaper-menu and awesome pot roast! \n\nTheir fare is strictly comfort food and always well-prepared.

Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.\n\nFirst off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.\n\nLets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.\n\nNext the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.\n\nDrinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.   \n\nNow the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here.\nNo value\n\nFood:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak.\nMy mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.\n\nDessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.\n\nValue:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!","5":"review","6":"zNR8Q6Fw9UvlVSgxwEy-3Q","7":"3","8":"10","9":"1"},{"0":"B6sT5YGBYB9KfhkiZtzQ4A","1":"2013-01-02","2":"IdFTGG7jVjN-NAJc09hKYg","3":"4","4":"We have tried every Chinese delivery in Chander over the past few years and have found them all to be barely edible...and we aren't picky eaters.

I mean really great and enough as a meal for two. For that alone I'd go back.\n\nMy better half had the Falafel Pita and thought it was OK.  I had the Gyros Pita and got luncheon meat. I'm talking precisely sliced, straight from the fridge but thrown on the grill to warm-up luncheon meat. If you go online to see the menu, it's one of the items you can click for a nutrition chart. Here's what it reads for the \"meat\" Gyro Beef [Beef, Lamb, Water, Bread Crumbs (Bleached Wheat Flour, Water, Dextrose,Salt and Yeast may contain soy bean oil, Calcium Propionate), Soy Protein Concentrate, Less thean 2% Salt, Garlic and Onion Powder, Monosodium Glutamate, ];\n\nSo, the takeaway here is stay away from the Gyro. \n\nBut, Hey!

My husband's barber told him his customers (the barber's) drive all the way from Scottsdale to eat here.    We decided to try it out after hearing this and reading good reviews about it on Yelp.   The first time we went for dinner.  I had the Osso Bucco and my husband had Seafood Paella.   Both were great.  I've had  Osso Bucco in high end restaurants that couldn't compare to this.   The second time we ate here for lunch.   Husband had the Philly Cheesesteak with Peppers, Onions, and Mushrooms.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.   I had some of his sandwich and we both agreed it was the best Cheesteak we've ever had.  The sandwiches are loaded with fillings and are not salty.   Spaghetti and Meatballs were good but I like Babbo's and Humble Pie's better.    I would have given it five stars but the atmosphere is not the best.

Must have eaten there twice a week minimum.  I was heartbroken when it turned into Armando Bros because as much as people told me they just changed their name, they didn't.  It was a different restaurant.  \n\nI had written it off as another great place gone to the pages of history until I moved near 48th and Baseline, and 'lo and behold there was Salazar's, tucked away in the Fry's parking lot next to a Little Caesars and a clothing outlet that appears to have escaped from the mall.  \n\nThe interior itself is cheaply thrown together and completely forgettable.  The only thing the employees seem to care about is making food.  And none of this bothers me because they make some damn amazing food for cheap prices.\n\nI recommend the adobada burrito with extra sour cream and 2 things of red sauce.  It's pork brushed with a delicious sauce of some sort.  Comes with pico and guacamole.  I sometimes have to convince myself to try something new off the menu.  Brownie points for carrying Pepsi products as well, I take Mountain Dew with my burritos.","5":"review","6":"WRY-wk7t2u7xxrIwWbQu0w","7":"1","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"7eUFOcfxuXDdrHGVSp3_9A","1":"2012-11-03","2":"ODykrO2NWH-RIAttQP7Q6g","3":"5","4":"I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times.

If you're from out of town, this would be a great place to stay since you'll be across the street from a ton of restaurants and bars.\n\nI went to an event here, and haved stayed here a few times.  JW Marriott has hosted a few wine tastings that I've gone to, and the resort is super nice, with a staff that is ready and waiting to help you no matter what it is you need.\n\nThe rooms were decently sized and the bed was big and comfy.  The bathroom was nice as well.   The resort has a lot of fountains around and huge windows so you can check out the great views.\n\nThe pool area is where it's at though.  They have a great lazy river to nurse your hangover on, and a water slide for when you're feeling better.  Of course you can get drink and food service out there and you can even rent a cabana- which I recommend.   It's not that pricey- around $100, so if you get a few people to go in with you, it's no biggie smalls. The servers are way more attentive to you when you have a cabana and you can choose different packages that come with water and fruit or lunch and so on.","5":"review","6":"0CMz8YaO3f8xu4KqQgKb9Q","7":"3","8":"3","9":"0"},{"0":"Gq092IH6eZqhAXwtXcwc6A","1":"2012-12-02","2":"OXFYCSpUaaNJWoW1zk0wYw","3":"4","4":"Great brewery and open atmosphere!

Here we go.\n\nTHE GOOD: \n* Great Sindhi biryani - the rice is flavorful, the chicken is tasty, all in all a great dish. \n* Chicken boti tikka (boneless pieces of marinated chicken grilled in a clay oven) - also tasty, but have had better elsewhere\n* Naan - Really good stuff. Crisp and soft in all the right places - exactly how it should be made. Better than 95% of other Indo-Pakistani places in the Valley.\n\nTHE BAD:\n* Chintzy interior which seemed like you just warped yourself straight back to the Punjab somewhere, complete with water-stained panels on the ceiling. 99.99% of the time, this doesn't faze me at all, but something was a little off and I don't know why.\n* A surly \"aunty type\" who's standing behind the register and doesn't even want to greet you unless you're apparently related to her or go to school with her kids\n* Said \"aunty type\" disappears into the kitchen for 5 minutes at a time, so you stand around and wait. And wait.\n* Said \"aunty type\" expresses nonverbal displeasure when you ask her for anything. Case in point: Asking her for tamarind chutney. Even though you waited for your food for 30 minutes.\n* Said \"aunty type\" brings back a tiny plastic cup of goopy, thick tamarind paste. Huh?\n* Said \"aunty type\" doesn't say \"thank you\", smile, or anything when you go up to pay, even though you've been nothing but friendly and appreciative. So much for engaging a potential repeat customer. She could care less about your patronage.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n* Big screen TV tuned to some badly acted Indian soap opera about some ancient king of Sri Lanka who tries to get it on with his handmaidens while his brother schemes for the throne while twisting one end of his moustache, but then switched to another channel showing bad, unknown songs from 4th-tier mid-90's Bollywood movies. Although I am not kidding you...there was one video where a guy and a girl were doing their running around and singing thing....in the SWISS ALPS. And then, all of a sudden, in the middle of all that snow, a table appears full of Indian food and an umbrella advertising beer and pretzels. WTF? \n\nSo, in the end, here's the equation:\n\n1 Pretty Good Food - 1 Dubious Dining Room - 1 Surly Aunty Type - 1 Singing/Shrieking Girl/Guy While Eating Curry On The Matterhorn Which Makes No Sense - 1 Overly Randy King of Ancient Sri Lanka Who No One Really Needs To See = 2 Stars.\n\nBah.","5":"review","6":"htC49ZwXiKNka5cp0GKBfQ","7":"5","8":"5","9":"7"},{"0":"9Y3aQAVITkEJYe5vLZr13w","1":"2012-10-18","2":"XS5Lvk8WFNmS0bCqdl-agw","3":"1","4":"My family and I ate here just a few days ago. It was an experience that left me yearning for more out of a restaurant I have seen so crowded over the years and decided to try with a group of 7 of us in the family. First off we got there at 10 am and were missing only two in our party so we had to wait to be seated which was fine. Once the rest of our party showed up at 10:07 we were not seated until after 10:30. When we were seated we were all scrunched together at a medium sized table that would comfortable seat 5 adults. Well, there were 7 of us total and needless to say it was very tight! The waitress stated that we could take our water and go wait back up front for a bigger table but we were looking at roughly 40 minutes of waiting again!!! Seriously? We ordered drinks first and the waitress brought my father his tomato juice and almost spilled it on him but instead spilled it all over her hand. Then she sat the glass down in front of him with juice on table and all over glass and left! She never came back with a wet towel to clean up her mess!! We all ordered and the food arrived quickly. This was the only part of the experience that was good, sadly to say. We received our food order for 7 of us within 15-20 minutes which was excellent. My uncle and grandmother both had charred toast (it was black, not just black around the edges) . The bacon looked like dried strips of hard leather. Overall, none of us will be returning to this place! It was is so overrated. We are headed back to RANDY'S here in Scottsdale to do our next family breakfast.","5":"review","6":"Hb49IsEZltm85wLz3uMrmw","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"XTIIAZspxssIF7WenlXmrA","1":"2011-09-11","2":"OG6fluz_DxfnMYcfnmmqrA","3":"3","4":"Spa whore, I am! I work in the industry, live in the industry and have breathed the industry for the last 5 years so I know spas. After a few stressful weeks of work, school and planning a wedding I suddenly remembered I am a better version of myself when I take adult time outs. My \"corner\", so to speak, was at Joya spa. I just so happen to remember a TravelZoo purchase I made a few months ago for a massage or facial at Joya Spa at the Montelucia Resort in Phoenix.\nBoy, was I excited! I called, booked an appointment with a male therapist and started to prepare myself for my next great spa adventure. \nAfter anxiously awaiting  Sunday to roll around, I finally found myself walking into a Moroccan paradise. The space was entrancing from the moment I walked in. It smelled like a spa and helped to set the mood for my day of relaxation. I was given a full tour of the facilities and allowed to set my intentions with small crystals in a round room, and then brought into a room with a GIANT crystal used to help calm, bring intention and awareness of your visit and to yourself. The woman giving me the tour was very professional and thorough. Though informative, I was waiting for a warm connection from her, and never received it.\nAfter being led to the locker room, I changed into my bathing suit and waited in the woman's lounge for my provider to find me and take me back for my massage experience.\nI chose a male provider. Knowing I had tension, knots and stress I was hoping for a firm, slow, relaxing massage. I have had MANY massages and this one was actually a little disappointing. My therapist picked me 7 minutes late and ended 5 minutes early. The strokes consisted of a lot of rocking and fast movements. Not really the relaxing experience I was craving. My massage therapist was very sweet and genuine in his approach, I was just hoping for something more.\nI definitely didn't let my treatment ruin my experience! The facilities were amazing!  They were clean and always stocked with towels. I have to say the spa attendants ROCKED!!!!! I could not believe how efficient they were. I observed on 5 occasions (YES 5) every time a shower was vacant an attendant was there to clean it up, any time a towel was on the floor, it got picked up immediately. They worked together like a well oiled machine! And I would love to give them props for making me take notice to the work the do!\nI plan on returning! I may not receive a massage because of my experience, but I truly enjoyed the facilities and the staff. I'm even thinking of booking a suite for my bridal party to enjoy the day there. In the end, if you know massage the way I do, please beware, you may not get all the bang for your buck in your treatment.","5":"review","6":"T2YhY--VPurB8rPJ-Q5giw","7":"2","8":"3","9":"2"},{"0":"55seKyxRWUmHC1s52xk45g","1":"2012-12-23","2":"CZeb1ZY4vRZFHH-ghe8-hg","3":"4","4":"Kinda of a rough and tumble crowd at times with the OTB booth in the back corner of the bar.

In this case, finally tried the food and it was surprisingly good. The waitress said that the buffalo wrap was good, so I went with grilled chicken tossed in mild wing sauce and that went into my wrap with the usual cheese, lettuce, some blue cheese and maybe a touch of bacon? THe wrap was huge and the chicken and blue cheese melded perfectly together. On the side dish selection wheel, I went with sweet potato fries - this was a decent version of that variety, but the raspberry sauce? served as a dipping option was a fail.

They also have a full service restaurant/bar off to the side where they have a huge \"by the glass\" list - you are also welcome to pick out any bottle from their store, they cork it free of charge, and you can enjoy your retail priced bottle with dinner!  \n\nThe portabello sliders that I had for dinner were amazing and I am still having dreams about them! \n\nMy one complaint is petty: their website.

My mom loved the salad when she went to Cowboy Ciao.\n\nSo we enter the restaurant and the place is so dark. How the heck are you suppose to find a table and read the menu?? We had no idea how the seating worked, so we asked a worker. We were seating within a couple of minutes. Mann.. we had to hold up the candle to read the menu. The environment is nice if you are just spending time with your friends and chatting. But to eat and see your food?? The darkness is not good for that.\n\nAnyway, we had the Stetson Chopped salad ($12). It was sooo good with the smoked salmon, dehydrated corn, pepita mixture, and the greens. Yummy!\n\nThe Burgundian Flatbread ($13) was also delicious! I liked the crispy crust and the chunks of brie!! Wow!!

Sometimes you really DO want a decent cheap pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less\n\nThe three years I lived nearby, I probably ordered Pizza Hut delivery or takeout once every couple of months, and I've never had anything to complain about at this location on Broadway\n\nPS - the boneless spicy bbq wings are dangerously addictive","5":"review","6":"VcN9i7sPrGSOn4BnpOJ9tQ","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"V1nEpIRmEa1768oj_tuxeQ","1":"2012-09-01","2":"0HsyKC9qSC07FPpQ2xOOsA","3":"4","4":"Cibo!

Its not worth it.\n\nExpect to wait in line wherever you go.\nASU accepts way too many people.\nIt would prolly accept my cat and my baby sister who barely talks if we threw money at them.\n\nThus its very difficult to get myself into the classes I need.\nThe advisors are walking advertisements of the business school.\nThey are not informed enough to advise you.\n\nI got dropped from two required prerequisite courses so I could not move on to the next level.... even after pre-registration.\nI got screwed and ended up having to take one more semester to graduate.\n\nTuition rose from 6000 a semester in Fall of 2003 to 9000 + in Fall of 2007.\nGross!!\n\nOne thing I liked was the student theatre performances.

There have a large array of flavors to choose from and they rotate flavors each month, they also have seasonal flavors such as pumpkin pie and egg nog. You also can get more than one flavor combined. They also have a wide variety of toppings to choose from, from gummy bears to low-fat brownies.\n\nEven though their yogurt is non-fat and low calorie, adding toppings can quickly add a lot more calories, I suggest going with chocolate or rainbow sprinkles (adds less than 50 calories), or if you like fruit, go with that.","5":"review","6":"MrQCy8eJD1x51U87J5C6ZQ","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"k8Y7aXXA8BFcn5CillHFYw","1":"2010-06-16","2":"raaH2O1gL1H712CjHv_lwQ","3":"3","4":"Not the newest or the nicest but, everything you need and usually no wait for machines.

So this was meant to be property that was sold in timeshares, which some have. mostly for winter weeks for cold snow birds.\n\nBut in the low season, which is summer, you can get a room for around $100. And what do you get? You get a nicely appointed, decorated model home, about a 700 square foot 1 bedroom apartment. It is repleat with 2 gas fireplaces, full kitchen with all wares and utensils, living room, patio with table and chairs, his/her bathroom sinks, a marbled tiled shower, a king size bed and a heart shaped large jacuzzi bathtub in the bedroom. \n\nIt has a full social and activities calender, so it is a good place to take the kids. There is a large clover shaped pool, with multiple water fountains, and a large rocklike island structure with caves where the jacuzzi is located. There are about 75 chaise lounges and several tables, so there is usually one available for you. There is also a poolside grill for food and beverages. \n\nYou are not far from the restaurants and nightlife of North Scottsdale, near Kierland Commons Mall, Desert Ridge Mall, 101 Mall, and about 6 other strip and big box shopping centers. You can buy food and easily eat in to save some money. The famed Tournament Players Club (TPC) gold course is close by, as well as the more exclusive and expensive Fairmont Princess hotel. \n\nThis is more of a vacation home than an exclusive resort with people waiting on you hand and foot. But it is well maintained, nicely appointed, and a relaxing getaway. Peak season (winter) rates are $325 and up, so if you come in early summer, you get a bargain and a tan by the pool.","5":"review","6":"2rlBbFPHyZjXSFSE8r551w","7":"4","8":"8","9":"0"},{"0":"k8JnZBspVOI8kLcQek-Chw","1":"2012-01-09","2":"dGzFMtE5JQ3YkUHS6UU0uA","3":"5","4":"I moved from Philly this past summer and I've searched all over the Valley for a \"GOOD\" Pizza.

My husband and I order the pizza/wing special .The wings are so hot and spicy ( we order the hot, but it comes in buffalo and mild) They have an extensive menu of pasta, sandwiches and salads.

I remember Golf Digest did a list of Top 25 College Courses and this didn't make it, which I thought was nuts.  My only complaint is that the course isn't really as luxurious as the peak season rate would indicate.  Also, as the other guys who reviewed this mentioned, there is some fantastic ASU swag available in the shop if you are a fan, they probably have every variety you could ever imagine.

Restaurant was understandably busy and there was a delay in the delivery of our food.\n\nWhen my pear omelet with potatoes arrived, it brought mixed reactions. The omelet itself was served hot, and loaded with bacon and cheese.  The potatoes served alongside were STILL FROZEN in the middle.   We were unable to catch the attention of the hectic servers to get this corrected. When I brought my plate to the bartender, he poked the potatoes with his fingers, and then asked me if it would be OK if he kept the same omelet, but \"throw some fresh potatoes\" on the plate.  The server said that, if the kitchen had to remake the omelet, there could be a long delay. \n\nI could only respond with a shrug. He left and went to the kitchen with my plate. Several other people touched and poked the plate and potatoes before replacing them.  He then brought the plate back to me at the bar, and not my table. \n\nEnd result - good omelet, mediocre potatoes, below-poor service and follow-up.","5":"review","6":"k8QnA7UNbe5DBCmYqxYs8Q","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"1NZLxU5WvB5roPFzneAlLw","1":"2008-11-02","2":"llMrv3u6jOOz2E9T7214mA","3":"2","4":"I've been to Barrio twice now.  Simply put, I do not believe that it is worth the prices that they charge. The first time I went there was with the pseudo boyfriend and he adored his meal, and so I embraced it and loved it.  The second time was last night for Dottsy's birthday dinner.  \n\nDottsy and I ordered up the guacamole that everyone raves about.  We were unimpressed, as we had huge chunks of avocado in there and have both made our own guacamole and didn't see what the big fuss was about.  \n\nI've had the enchiladas suizas and enchiladas de hongas and although they weren't bad- they were not amazing.  Not worth the 16 bucks, at all.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't complain about the cost if it tasted like it was worth it, but not so much.\n\nBecause it was Dottsy's birthday, they brought her a complimentary flan which we both agreed was pretty tasty flan.  So, if you are a flan person, this may be a place to check out.  I am not a flan person- too jiggly (which makes me think of what fat looks like on a person's body which stops me from eating it).\n\nThe two things that make this place worth going for are the margaritas and the service.  The margaritas are 50% tequila and fabulous- I usually just stick to the house margarita and am satisfied.  The people that work at Barrio are friendly and cool.  I imagine that they all enjoy working there.\n\nI don't really ever need to go back to Barrio, unless I'm craving a serious margarita served up by a cute hipster.  I'd go for a drink or two and then go elsewhere for dinner.","5":"review","6":"0lxf4v5NuJ1U6Bk7SGAJ5w","7":"10","8":"9","9":"9"},{"0":"AkOruz5CrCxUmXe1p_WoRg","1":"2012-09-24","2":"1n6AhAJ6n92x_vesTaWZyA","3":"4","4":"Now THIS is ramen!

I'd definitely try again while dining in to see if the quality I'd the pork improved. The rest of the ramen was so tasty it didn't matter! \n\nAlso, for take out the service was super quick and friendly. The prices are great, too!

Zoe's serves Mediterranean just like Qdoba serves Mexican.\n\nWhen I say just like the Q, I mean the entire experience. Walking into the shop gives more of a cookie cutter national chain feel; which is probably because they are in fact a chain of restaurants. Zoe's food was average and unimpressive. I did like the hummus though. Their prices similar to independent and family operated Mediterranean around the valley; in some cases more. I would prefer to visit Cypress Grill, just up the street from this location, they're my favorite Medi in CenPho so far. \n\nThe staff here was friendly, they took our order promptly and served the food within a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, the food was in no way \"bad\", per se. I just can't shake the feeling of \"I've had better\" when thinking about my experience.\n\nIf you're looking to fill your belly with food just because it's time to eat, this might just be the place for you.

Great food! Great service! Still, this place isn't perfect....\n\nBE PREPARED TO WAIT! Alright, most people seem to know this going in (we did too). However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you won't be seated until 11:30pm, that doesn't mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If you're not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown. At 10:00pm we were deemed worthy to stay on the list and wait another 45 minutes or so.\n\nService: the hostess knows she holds all the cards--sort of like the lady at the cash register for the Soup Nazi. However, a smile was all it took to get one back from her for me. Still, I can see how others might misconstrue her attitude as something less than cordial. Our server was great though! Very helpful and fun. He was as excited to serve us as we were to eat there. Good stuff!\n\nThe pizza is indeed great! But after waiting 4 hours, I was expecting the heavens to part and birds to sing and the ground to shake. Nope. Just made-from-scratch, meticulously-thought-out, high-quality pizza. A light and airy, smoky crust, a decent sauce and fresh mozzarella formed the basis of the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas that we tried. The quality and tastiness of the toppings were also apparent. We were impressed. This was absolutely great pizza--one of the best we've ever had. ...I just don't know if I'll hurry back to Pizzeria Bianco to wait that long again.","5":"review","6":"UuwjD6MZf6Z6QlNphiXRjA","7":"3","8":"6","9":"1"},{"0":"BINYfrtGp3A4w0d5E7kbYw","1":"2012-04-22","2":"oIPCrYI-fRmOFaDcJGMoLg","3":"5","4":"Very delicious and friendly!

She had a great personality and was attentive and informative, pretty much everything you would want in a waitress.\n\nWe ordered everything off the happy hour menu, so I can't comment on the main menu, but the happy hour food was great!  The Hubs and I shared the pork tacos and chicken tacos - he loved the chicken and I loved the pork - go figure.  We shared guacamole, which was good, but needed a bit more seasoning.  By adding the salsa, which was served with it, it became quite good.  BTW, love the unique \"chips\" that are served here... some of our had a ton of seasoning and others had only a little - we liked the ones with just a little.  We also shared the empanadas (I think that's what they were), anyway they were really good.\n\nOverall, we had a great happy hour experience here.  It thoroughly redeemed my not so enthusiastic impression from the Yelp event here (just about the food, not the event).

The major downfall (and I say major because the whole point of a hotel is to sleep) is that the bed pillows are so incredibly uncomfortable.  It is almost impossible to fall asleep.

A MEXICAN FOOD EXPERIENCE IN THE THEME-PARK STYLE.\n\n--colorful, tasteful, vibrant ambiance in the country-hacienda style; kudos to the designers with an eye for detail;\n--dining room draws natural light from the delightful patio windows to the vaulted ceilings above;\n--this place and the adjacent ranch market are a \"must-do\" for tourists (bring your out-of-towners here);\n\n--Don't miss the Parrilla (grilled platter); one \"portion\" serves two; choose three meats and voice your tortilla preference;\n--grilled vegetables include nopales (cactus), Mexican zucchini squash, jalapenos (consumed whole, took me to five hiccups before my stomach settled), and baby onion stalks (not the typical pile-o-fajita yellows);\n--both rice and beans served family style, and perfectly flavored. I could just sit and eat bowl after bowl of those beans;\n--juicy, perfectly cooked shrimp; \"asada\" goodness knows no bounds;\n--guacamole is plentiful (no melon-ball scoops of yesterday at $3/ea here!) and freshly made to order; NOW THAT'S what I'm TALKing about !!!\n--table salsa is spicy with lots of freshly chopped chilis and pureed onions; really good burn;\n--try the horchata (rice milk and cinnamon sugary goodness) or any of the featured Aguas Frescas.\n--no fuss over separate checks (and that was for our table of 10!)\n\n--pork was a bit dry; is \"gamey\" possible in pork?\n--server forgot our desserts and we gave up after 20 minutes (shucks! they were sitting right there on the pass!); the manager refunded us promptly and then packaged them to-go.\n\nAfter so many recent disappointments on rock-hard rubbery shrimp, I _finally_ found a place that grills properly, excellent marinade, and with the freshest ingredients. If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more!\n\nIf you don't have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest you'll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room.\n\nDon't miss the Ranch Market next door; you won't see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town.

Limited run.  Copyright 2009, Mejimbo Enterprises.  All Rights Reserved.  \n\nDateline 7 May 2009\nScottsdale, Arizona\n\n    Yelpers Jim W and Audrey W were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious Indian food with Donald S and Carin S.  Witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times.  One bystander reported, \"That was a guffaw.  That outburst right there was definitely a guffaw.  Wild stuff.\"\n\n    Sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers, one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan bread.  Jim W was overheard to say, \"I really like the onion naan.\"  The other appetizer may have been Aloo Tikki.  This has not been confirmed as yet.  In any case the plate containing the reported Aloo Tikki was cleaned by the foursome, several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate.\n\n    The above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the Friday daily special of Kahari Shrimp.  It was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was \"...flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger.\"  This has not substantiated, however.\n\n    Audrey W reportedly was served the Lamb Korma which she was rumored to have noted was \"Yummy.\"\n\n    Carin S apparently was served the Chicken Masala and Donald S may have been served some sort of Vindaloo that included potato.  It seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati rice with various herbs and spices.\n\n    An unnamed source has informed this publication that while Jim W claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly dancer and some swordplay, he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in-house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced.\n\n    Jim W's blog had a statement this morning that read, in part; \"...ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert.  I really liked the food but I wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again.\"","5":"review","6":"P2kVk4cIWyK4e4h14RhK-Q","7":"22","8":"23","9":"27"},{"0":"fP-BPL6iRu2tbcvlnjRshw","1":"2011-08-20","2":"ZPdAsJQOE50mgxgziI4gkw","3":"4","4":"Good drinks, great food, and cool music.

I'm hesitant to add another good review of this great place because I didn't have to fight anyone for a table, and I would like to be able get one in the future.\n\nAnyway... I'm a huge fan of brunch (and especially of Mexican/Latin American-type brunches), so I was thrilled to try this place. My friend ordered the Verde Vaqueros, which are their verison of biscuits and gravy. But the biscuits are no ordinary biscuits, they're Green chile beer biscuits (!) with smoked sausage gravy from Schreiners. The biscuits were delicious. I could eat them with anything... or really without anything else. My friend cleaned his plate. I got the stacked chicken enchiladas because I'm a sucker for anything with hatch chiles, and they did not disappoint. The sauce was flavorful, and the crispy tortillas were a nice texture contrast to the rest of the dish.\n\nWill definitely be back, and would definitely recommend that people check this place out for brunch... just don't take my table.","5":"review","6":"KzFTp00JdzuggUHaRn_uzQ","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"V6BYjHM9SnXscfkln3hCdA","1":"2012-06-27","2":"h3vM0J9MuqpLscQAPp5hfQ","3":"1","4":"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of \"computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \n\n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.","5":"review","6":"TwK4rCo5Q_OnEP3874xTLg","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"o4DsvwwD2kIbF-EM4r9G8A","1":"2008-02-10","2":"wBGJfwLCFIIli9X5LRoHpA","3":"4","4":"After SMOCA opening night, I just wanted to relax with some friends and not go get wasted or have to wait a long time to get a seat at a trendy bar on a Friday night. Oh yeah, and get something to eat. I had remembered some generally good reviews of Drift, had noticed it when going to shows at Martini Ranch, and really wanted something with coconut (?).\n\nAfter a terrifying short-cut with a walking GPS that I was sure was leading us to our death (or at least led us to dog-shit on the sidewalk at one point), we ended up here with a nice enough door guy. Inside I was really impressed. It was a lot nicer than I thought it would be, more sophisticated and while it was Tiki-themed, I thought it was very tongue in cheek COOL interpretation of tiki (very hard to pull off). \n\nWe asked for a booth and got one near the door (which lead to superior people watching later). Our booth was creamy, spacious, left us with no ass swamp, (although the acoustics were a little bad-I had trouble hearing someone two people away) and showed us more intimate tables in very Ikea-esqe and mod black leather. This place is surprisingly classy. The giant aquarium at the bar was goregous and if I ended up here with one other person, I would def. sit there.\n\nOur waitstaff was extremely sweet, the food (veggie spring rolls, coconut shrimp, and pot stickers) were not that expensive (5-8) and surprisingly good. Kristin and I got two orders of spring rolls. We took the longest time deciding drinks-I got the old fashioned Pina Colada in a coconut shell (YUM) and Erica got the Evil Bastard which was set on fire and it was damn potent. I was very giggly the rest of the night. \n\nLooking around, this WAS not a pick up scence. Groups of friends just sat around chatting. On the way to the bathrooms, a small open lounge was dominated by one party having a lot of fun. The bathroom sink blew my mind and I still don't know what sets it off...although my theory is some dude needs to flush the toilet for water to come down and vice versa. I started freaking out in my drunky state, saying \"I have soapy hands goddamit! And I'm smart! How does this shit turn on!\" wiping my hands on the sink with tiny amounts of water.\n\nOverall, a very chill scene with a bizarre assortment of people (bro dogs, homely couples, musicians, barbies, and just regular folks) perfect for a second or third date for a casually romantic drink or two.","5":"review","6":"mfvezpz6ohS0NQk3DZdvqQ","7":"8","8":"7","9":"4"},{"0":"yypKLRJxSjR2uNaTS_O6pw","1":"2011-02-14","2":"IP-mkqqLSLJp9IVd7VaHSA","3":"3","4":"Been here several times for lunch and had the pizza.

Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing, music is not blasting so customers don't have to scream over each other, and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.\n\nThe coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I don't know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.\n\nA surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.","5":"review","6":"WEuIqh8ygm-bH81s8lwD0g","7":"11","8":"15","9":"5"},{"0":"P5a2hK5G64J7DcNwLAPhuA","1":"2012-11-29","2":"Rl1gotAIgb8wHCi48puewQ","3":"1","4":"I never got a chance to try the food because I was so turned off by the way I was treated.

They had opera singers from the Phoenix Symphony performing which were very good.  I enjoyed my handmade ravioli with spinach and yummy cheese (not fish yay!) filling and the wine and the mouse.

The server also informed him that they'd been able to process someone else's but one other didn't go through.  My date checked his account on line and it had plenty to cover, but had just enough cash to cover the tab, not really enough for a tip.  So he asked the server if they would try to put a lesser amount on the card to cover the tip and take the cash.  This is when the server informed us that the machine might be down and it wasn't just his it was everyone's! So he kinda lied earlier, which wasn't cool.  We then waited another 30 minutes without an appearance by the server to explain what was going on, although I could see Marcellino working on the machine, even trying his own card.  My date got up to go speak with him, and the server tried to divert him, but he was respectful and wanted to speak with the owner.  No attempt was made to really apologize for the delay or make up for the wait...so they wrote down his information and address to mail him a receipt.\n\nThen, the next day, he checked his account and he'd been charged twice!! :( sad, because I thought I might like to go back at some point.","5":"review","6":"sA0sK9l9VxsynxvrOgmBXQ","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"R2IWbpUgJQ3NRRjKQy6O_Q","1":"2012-05-21","2":"Om_B3VbViUp9hzk42Xn20Q","3":"5","4":"This my favorite Chipotle ever!!!

The place does not disappoint when it comes to service, it is warm, quick and attentive. The complimentary papadums (Indian flatbread) with homemade chutneys (condiments) is usually the high point of a meal at SoI. \n\nExperiences with the order could be as follows: \nGobi Parantha (Indian bread stuffed with cauliflower)- The real thing is meant to be fluffy and served with butter but the SoI parantha resembles a topping-less thin crust pizza. \nLamb korma- The gravy is thick, nutty with a lot of authentic flavours but the meat tastes pre-cooked. \nChicken biriyani- it is difficult to describe the God-food that is biryani but SoI manages to serve a new variation which is nothing more than chicken pieces thrown into a mishmash of rice and vegetables. \nDisheartenment with the over-priced, sub-standard food could lead to a decision of not ordering dessert. \n\nFinally, as observed in other reviews and the menu, if you visit this place then stick with the tandoori stuff and Chef's specialities. However in that case the excitement of an extensive menu will be lost.","5":"review","6":"LMlBCXFVAHdPnSA94jc6PQ","7":"1","8":"2","9":"1"},{"0":"gXkv89nyNlFyrEdblB3MKw","1":"2011-07-11","2":"_vzqn2kve9Mp05Vsm_c7ow","3":"5","4":"great 3D Imax theater,,,see the Transformers...very spectacular","5":"review","6":"nM3vfxr6fcnN_nXdzwbVCw","7":"1","8":"1","9":"2"},{"0":"nfyqtEoufkhjv97IueK7Ow","1":"2011-03-04","2":"6-Bd6EH7f4iOClnPi3R5pg","3":"1","4":"Here's the 1. 2. 3...\n\n1.

GREAT DEAL! Ask for your meal to go, so you don't have to pay 50 cents for take out box :)\n\nHow do you get 3+ meals, you might ask? PACKING & SMUSHING! First, add some meat, and use the wax paper to pack down the meat all along the sides and the bottom of the bowl. Try to avoid empty spaces in between every piece of meat. Then add your vegetables, and smush it all down with the wax paper with each layer of veggies you add. Make sure to add enough meat and veggies so that your have a flat surface up to the brim of the bowl. Add lots of green onions for extra flavor.\n\nI recommend using the wheat noodles, because you can create a taller mountain of noodles and it's healthier!\n\nAdvice for the sauce: ADD LOTS OF IT. Since you're now a packing queen/king, you can't use the recipes on YC's wall, either double up or triple up.\n\nAsk the nice Mongolian BBQ chefs to add pineapples and cilantro, and then when they finish cooking up your food, add some sesame seeds for that lil extra somethin somethin!","5":"review","6":"Vyl9tU5OeDcZND37iObmOw","7":"2","8":"3","9":"2"},{"0":"Agz-gMJfjCsK5tdKC6FBYQ","1":"2011-05-04","2":"JpmTOGXZYOwEY3tV7x2OoA","3":"3","4":"Not bad.

The decor was a little non-descript, but that's OK, All in all, a nice addition to the meager choices for Mexican food in Surprise.

The organic-y menu ranges from special dietary needs (Gluten-free, Egg-free, Dairy-free, etc.) to proteins from Vegan to Free-Range Meats.   All foods are well marked for dietary-restrictions.   Yesterday, we had a great roasted chicken and hamburger (gf bun--burger was a bit bland and dry but wifey was happy just having meat, since I do the cooking for us.)  The quinoa is quite tasty too.  The sweet potato-avacodo salad is great, as are the fries.  The 'free' cucumber water is very refreshing, to which I have adopted having a pitcher in my own kitchen.\n\nThe second reason the kitchen is REALLY COOL is that it is a COLD kitchen, with no ventilation.  Food is pre-cooked in kilm-like ovens, then when ordered, the prep work is to put into 800 degree Air-Fryers (and yes, no oil is used, it's an air dryer that looks like a jet-turbine engine).  It makes awesome fries and crispy skins on chicken.  Some done-ness variation does occur in this process; nonetheless, it works well for restaurants with not exhaust.\n\np.s.

There's some good people watching to be done here - cops eat here, firemen eat here, doctors and nurses eat here, and you also get the entire spectrum of downtown Scottsdale folk... sometimes you would think you arrived at a costume party or they are filming a new Village People video. I don't know what it is and I don't know that it matters either, but good looking people eat here. Whatever you want to make of that... \n\nMost of the people that work here are really nice and competent. They keep this place pretty clean as well.

I really could just survive on those happily for the rest of my life. The grape preserves on the side are fantastic as well...and I don't even like grape preserves! That, paired with their coffee, makes for one of the best breakfasts in the Valley. And, if you're splurging? Go for the salted chocolate chip cookie if they have it. It makes me happy just thinking about it. :-)\n\nThis place is great if you have a weekday morning available to come here..or an hour or two on the weekend. The little shopping area is great to browse around - when you can figure out a way through all the people in line! Don't get me wrong..the food is fantastic. I just like a little more relaxation on my weekend than fighting through the hordes just to get that amazing english muffin. It's worth it, but then I just feel tired.....annoyed. And that's really not how I want to start my weekend off. \n\nIf you can....call in the order for Curbside Pick Up.

I absolutely loved the atmosphere. Matta's has an upper level where every table is set up like a balcony over looking the main level, it feels like your in a courtyard. The only thing it's missing is an open look at the sky. There was also a mariachi band playing during the night which added to the appeal. And to make things really cool (at least to me), they did a Mexican version of the Godfather theme song. Loved it! \n\nThe chips and salsa came out right away. The hot had a kick to it, but wasn't very flavorful. The mild was excellent, but I prefer my Salsa hot. I tried combining the two, which was only okay. The menu isn't really anything special. It's a lot smaller than most Mexican restaurants, and is loaded with the standards. My girlfriend had a chicken burrito which she enjoyed. I had the chicken fajitas, which were good as well. The food was good, but not great enough to make me run back out. \n\nThe service was excellent. Our waitress was on top of everything despite the fact that we were on the upper level. We watched and felt a little bad as she had to run up and down the stairs (she usually took the stairs that weren't as visible, but you know what's going on) to get everything for us. I could imagine that if a server were having a bad enough day, they would just make people up there and wait. \n\nWe just randomly chose Matta's because we happened to be at Mesa Riverview. I enjoyed my experience there. While it's not a place that I'm dieing to try again, if someone suggests Mexican, and we're nearby, I'd recommend it.","5":"review","6":"thdVzCfKx-DV0zYWqId3pw","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"UUssRgBCO_riWg3chbv9Zg","1":"2011-12-27","2":"gNepvdQlS4feEB92g33qVw","3":"2","4":"Not impressed.

There was no BBQ the day we were there and I just wasn't feeling the place. \n\nMy hubby and I have been missing this place since it closed its original restaurant in Cave Creek. We heard it moved to Phoenix and we found it and went there this past week. Unfortunately, it was nothing like the old, hopping, smell good, smokey, fun filled environment of the original SF. \n\nI can see that they have a lot of regulars and the barkeep knew everyone that walked through the door, which to me,  was very cool, but it just wasn't gelling for me this night I suppose. \n\nWe ordered the deep Fried green chili's and there was soooo much batter  on them, I had to really concentrate hard to find the chili. I ended up peeling all of the batter off of the chili's just to get a small bite. icky. \n\nI would give this another chance just because I hate writing a bad review.

They're real, and they're spectacular. \n\nOf course, being all-natural one is just a slight bit larger than the other, but this is barely noticeable. Camelback is barely 100 feet higher than Piestewa, whose nipple... er... summit, is at 2608 feet. Climb either one and you can enjoy great views of the other at various vantage points, not to mention views of the city. \n\nAlthough Camelback strikes me as a funner climb, I give Piestewa 5 stars because for what it lacks in the intangible fun factor it makes up with being just a tad less insanely crowded. Piestewa Peak Park also has a number of really cool looking trails that don't go up to the summit, which look to me to be worth exploring some day.\n\nSpeaking of female body parts, the former name for this peak was \"Squaw\" Peak. This has inspired one of the most ridiculous controversies in modern times in our state. Native Americans are offended by the term \"Squaw\", and regardless of the linguistic origins of the word, it is basically the equivalent of terms such as \"Negress\" or \"Jewess\". In the 1990s, the State of Arizona proposed ending the controversy by renaming the peak after our greatest political leader ever and the father of American conservatism, Barry Goldwater. The whining dipshits who apparently constitute our voting population rejected the idea. They'd rather continue using a stupid name that has no historical or sentimental value whatsoever just to spite Native Americans, rather than honoring one of their finest citizens.\n\nAnd so, in this decade, Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano put an abrupt end to the whole issue. She gave the sqaw-apologists the finger and ordered the renaming of the peak to Piestewa, after Lori Piestewa, the first US woman soldier to be killed in the 2003 Iraq war and a member of the uniquely-Arizonan Hopi Nation. A fitting end to the debate.\n\nNOTE: Even more fitting, the original name of this peak was Squaw Tit Peak, and I swear to God I'm not making that up to be funny.","5":"review","6":"17PPxx8RxjOUD_nQZ1aHEw","7":"5","8":"6","9":"11"},{"0":"UAATzhTdfd43S8F0SwXDcw","1":"2012-09-07","2":"jw-Hqj5F0SO33vRhw0W5zA","3":"5","4":"I just love Chipotle.

I had a small Chipotle Chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink, for only $10.58. The soup was great! And they let me sample several kinds before making my decision. I also loved that they had at least a dozen different kinds of hot sauce bottles on the wall that customers are free to use as they please. I tried three because I like to bring the heat and because they were available.  \n\nMy only complaint was that the dirty dish bin was overflowing even though the place was super slow. Can't someone handle that? Its gross to have to move other people's dirty dishes around in order to fit yours in there.

So don't judge this place based on ONE dish you don't like.

For the day, ours included a cheese, a stuffed olive, and whole leaves of broccolini. The cheese wedge was great (I wish I remembered what it was), and have you ever had a deep fried veal-stuffed olive? Very interesting. The flash-fried broccolini took a little getting used to, since the leaves kept crumbling as I was trying to eat them, but still tasty, if subtle.\n\nMain: Orecchiette alla Puttanesca. Man. This is the real deal. Orecchiette is the \"little ear\" pasta and \"alla puttanesca\" means it's made \"whore style\". \n\nAnd what a beautiful, classy, yet very vibrant whore she is.\n\nThe pasta was cooked just perfectly, and even though puttanesca sauce usually goes with a stringier pasta (spaghetti, linguini, etc.) it worked really well with the orecchiette. \n\nAnd the sauce. Holy mother, this streetwalkin' hussy of a sauce with its 12 ingredients: capers, breadcrumbs, anchovy sauce, garlic, olives, basil, olive oil, and, uh, the other 5. The flavors were a perfect, clear-heeled harmony. Nothing overpowered the other. Subtle and humble home food. It really tasted just like something my Italian friends' mothers would cook in their kitchen.\n\nAs for the servings, when I first got my bowl I was thinking, \"oh ok, this is a European serving. I'm still going to be starving after this.\" And, um, nope. Why? Because I slowed down. I savored my meal, and took my time with the dish. And by the end, was I hungry? Not at all. I really enjoyed this meal. And the serving was just right. Complimentary packs of long breadsticks are also found on each table. \n\nSERVICE\n-------------\nVery friendly, efficient, and willing to go through the menu in detail and answer any more questions about the restaurant. Dishes were brought out in a timely manner and there was never any rush after the meal was completed to clear the table. \n\nAnd the mood inside Pastabar was palpable. Everyone looked happy, excited, and relieved that the restaurant was finally open for business. And I felt the same for them. \n\nSETTING\n-------------\nI would say the space was just the right size. Not a cavernous place in the least. Probably the same size as Sens, maybe  even a little smaller. It's tucked away in the very back of the hallway of the building, so much so that I completely missed it when I was IN THE HALLWAY the previous afternoon looking for it. But I like it a little hidden off, actually. \n\nThe colors inside are warm, with a modern bistro feel. No windows looking outside but I didn't mind that. There is seating at the bar, a few two-tops up front, and larger tables in the back. Selections from different Shins albums made up the soundtrack throughout the dinner, and while the music sounds like it could be incongruous with a bunch of little ears cooked whore-style, it worked. \n\nI definitely don't think this is going to be as \"scene-y\" as Sens. It has a completely different vibe. \n\nEXTRA CRIB NOTES\n-----------------------------\n* the main courses of Pastabar are pasta and ONLY pasta. No veal parm here. And no hoikey sauces like Olive Garden-y alfredo or a jar of sugary Prego.\n* It's great\n* Prices for antipasti range from $7-$11-ish and mains $11-ish to $18. I spent around $26 with tax and a nice tip.\n* it's great\n* No liquor license (yet). For now, sparkling waters, lemonades, a number of sodas (including root beer & cream soda). \n* it's great\n* complimentary valet awaits the diners, if you're averse to parking close by yourself.\n* it's great\n* It's open till midnight on weeknights and 2 am on weekends! What more could you ask for?\n* did I tell you it's great?\n\nALL IN ALL\n---------------\nAn awesome asset to the area and I'm very content. And as much as I loved my whoreish little ears, all the other pastas on the menu sounded incredible and I can't wait to try them all. \n\nI'm wishing these guys much success and giving them gratitude to finally being open. A few minor kinks to be worked out (and I wasn't as into the appetizer as I was my entree) so it's not totally perfect but they have started out very strong, and it's only Day 2.\n\nAnd here I was thinking my days of giving out 5 stars were over (ok, more like 4.55 and rounding up)...","5":"review","6":"htC49ZwXiKNka5cp0GKBfQ","7":"17","8":"16","9":"13"},{"0":"fi5TM0p_6es4QEw8SKRSfw","1":"2010-02-21","2":"hfUpkVDfarhfaogS_Y0YOA","3":"5","4":"This has by far been my favorite movie theater and favorite movie chain in Arizona.

Dallas was the person who helped me (I think he's one of the owners?) and he was sooooo friendly and knowledgeable I spent more than I was originally planning but I feel good about it actually.\n\nI had looked at the pricing online so I had an idea of what I wanted but he explained things about the beds that I never knew and that none of the other salons I'd been to had ever told me.

He made sure I knew every detail of the beds, the differences, gave recommendations and was never pushy with any of it.  During our conversation several people came in and he always asked my permission first to take care of them and I don't think he had to ask for their names once, a good sign that he pays attention and remembers his customers.\n\nI could go on and on because I was so impressed with his service and also the location itself (super clean, trendy, nice extras in the rooms like baby wipes and extra towels) but I think you get the point by now.

She told us our options, but was very upfront about the liklihood that our kitty would pass no matter what we did.  She didn't pressure us one way or another, and left the room so that we could talk privately and make our decision.  My husband asked if they could give her some pain meds while we talked about it, and they gave her some immediately.\n\nOnce we made our difficult decision to put our kitty down, she brought the cat into a private room with us so that we could say goodbye.  She left us alone and gave us as much time as we needed.  She also let us be present in the room when they gave her the final shot.  At all times the doctor and the techs were compassionate and very respectful.  I was crying and they were very sensitive to my feelings.  They treated my little kitty so gently even after she had passed.  They even sent a sympathy card to our house a few days later.  I really appreciated how they helped us through this difficult time, and I would definitely reccommend them if anyone else is in a similar situation.","5":"review","6":"GF6IArfVHEFAQmwekt7wug","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"l1kqHWtICTNk8TdCNisf5A","1":"2011-03-29","2":"x08RjoY6FzKBAqLWIw5psg","3":"5","4":"OK, yeah, everyone LOVES teriyaki, we know!\n\nWell, don't so quickly dismiss the other absolutely AMAZING dishes served here!  It may look like a little pre-processed Japanese hole in the wall from the outside, but they're a die hard home-made mom and pop your mouth full of great food establishment!\n\nI'd highly recommend trying the Katsu bowl! You can hardly find ANY kind of Japanese katsu in AZ, yet they have an excellent one that's very traditional, but not too expensive! I'd love to explain the mystique of this dish, but too many people think that fried egg with onions and leeks topped over a diced pork cutlet that's coated in panko bread crumbs is too strange to be palatable.  Well, to them I say you should educate your tongue, and expose it to some delicious culture! \n\nThere's also Orange chicken... This dish is completely the bee's knees. It easily and without remorse makes Panda Express look like a burnt out oil can that a homeless person decided to cook some chicken in over a pile of burning newspapers.\n\nTheir house beef? Spicy garlic brown sauce and beef with mushrooms? Heaven.  Simple and delicious.\n\nAnd I haven't even mentioned their coup de grace yet.  Their fried rice might seem a little \"heavy\" on the surface as it's lightly fried with some garlic oil, but it outclasses all competitors.  Paired with their lightly fried shrimp, it's sweet garlic love.  Seriously, their fried rice is the Sean Connery of fried rices.\n\nAs I've been eating here for far longer than I'd like to admit, I'd have to say I might be a little biased.

Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum. \n\nSo why only three stars? Well It's actually 3.5 stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off. Like I said the place was empty and yet our server either forgot about us at times or was busy doing something else in the back. Nicole, our server was sweet enough but still.... hmmm. Oh well no biggie. It was empty and we did get in and out in under an hour but not 5 star worthy. Will I be back again? Probably as the food was pretty good.

However, once I walked in, I realized that any semblance of having an authentic Chinese meal went out the window (no offense, my hungry white friends!). \n\nI decided to try it out anyway, was seated by a friendly waiter and ordered the hot & sour soup (they were able to sub in chicken instead of pork - bonus) and the waiter recommended the house chicken to me. I asked for it to be made really spicy, knowing full well it wasn't going to be (no one EVER listens to me when I demand the food be spicy - listen, dammit, I'm brown, people). Anyway, that's my issue.\n\nThe hot & sour soup arrived, and it was excellent. I was happy. Nothing mars a Chinese meal more than beginning it with a bowl of shiteous soup. Then came the house chicken (with string beans added for $1). Steamed rice costs another extra buck - I get annoyed when Chinese restaurants don't make it complimentary, but again, my issue. Anyway, the chicken was just ok. Nothing amazing and it still ended up feeling pretty heavy. So that dish I'm more willing to give it 2.5 stars. \n\nSo why did I bump up the star wattage? I guess the service. \n\nThe waiter:\n\n* noticed I wasn't devouring my dish and offered to switch it for any other dish of my choice, no extra charge. Who does this nowadays - in a Chinese restaurant no less? Extra star.\n* is from the SF Bay Area like myself, so he gave me the lowdown for good Asian food in Phoenix (for dimsum he recommended Golden Buddha first, Great Wall second, C-Fu third - then for Vietnamese he recommended some place on 19th Ave between Indian School & Camelback.) He agreed that Thai, Korean, and sushi in Phoenix is kind of a letdown compared to California, but almost all the Asian restaurants (he admitted, including China Chili) cater to their core customers, who by sheer demographics are pretty much not Asian. That said, he told me that China Chili is THE place people go to for Chinese food, including Chris Bianco (of Pizzeria Bianco), the mayor, folks from Channel 10 news, the owner of the Diamondbacks, etc. etc. So take that for what you will.\n* When I asked if this China Chili was affiliated with...\"oh, the one in Fremont? No. But people say that place is good and fancy and has an electric piano.\" Bonus points for knowing that.\n\nAnyway, he recommended I come back and get the Mongolian beef next time, which I'll definitely do, plus the hot & sour soup. I didn't mind the big open seating area - many Chinese restaurants in SF are like this, loud and raucous. \n\nAll in all, China Chili is a case where service overcame the food (again, how often does that happen?) to come back and give it another shot. \n\nAnd there you have it.","5":"review","6":"htC49ZwXiKNka5cp0GKBfQ","7":"2","8":"4","9":"1"},{"0":"1eJiyKXx_ruNu6F36BJQCg","1":"2010-10-02","2":"4GN4dKHBVHEMzWyAGkZ6bw","3":"3","4":"a bit too sweet (sweeter than Yogurtland and Red Mango), but liked the skinny mango and blueberry flavors, excellent spread of toppings (incl. green tea mochi) and great quality fruit. perfect stop-in on Mill.","5":"review","6":"r8xfTpifZ7gP5Cd5CSQaIQ","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"91n02N35x38nvR1XH-jOAw","1":"2012-11-03","2":"yG7p1fhb0q8Pz_oUGU834g","3":"3","4":"Very VERY average.

Occasionally, I have stopped into Mill's End for breakfast, specifically because they have crepes on their menu; in fact, their breakfast menu is actually fairly extensive for a small cafe.  For reasons explained below, lately I've found myself just walking past Mill's End, no longer considering giving it my business.  The general issues that I have with this place involve just a couple of basic things; if the owners made the effort to correct these, I believe Mill's End could be a great cafe.\n\nI have always thought there are three factors that can make a cafe stand out from its competitors.  It is with all three of these that Mill's End falls short: \n\n1)Ambience.  This means that the environment must be suitable both for studying/reading, as well as relaxation.  So, the music playing needs to be something that is non-intrusive and that the customers can generally ignore; sometimes Mill's End has this covered, but other times not at all.  Onto the seating.  It seems that this cafe was decorated back in 1995, in an attempt to capture the coziness of the cafe on the TV show \"Friends;\" unfortunately, they didn't come close, but there is usually plenty of seating open.  By the way, what is up with pseudo-sexual ice photography on the walls?\n\n2)Price.  This is actually my number one problem with Mill's End.  The coffee is reasonably priced, but the food is too expensive.  Anytime I tell someone that I ate there, it's always the same response, \"yeah, their food is good, but it's really pricey.\"  Considering that this place is literally ten feet from a major light rail stop, I imagine that their business has gone up, but those prices sure haven't dropped.\n\n3.Customer service.  The staff has always been just lukewarm.  Look, I don't expect the staff in cafes and restaurants to be smiling like idiots all of the time, I only want to feel welcomed with a bit of hospitality; this has just always been kind of lacking at Mill's End.\n\nHonestly, I think this place has a lot of potential, but it seems to be awash in complacency.","5":"review","6":"ykg3-2C-8Vv3K4mVj1iSfA","7":"1","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"t_0576Esa58pcLHCEpj31A","1":"2010-11-14","2":"rHFrTHicKvplYqoAUl__FA","3":"4","4":"Really nice jumping point for a good night in Phoenix.

There was no parking available, so we had to go across the street. There were also too many people, so crowding and navigation were problematic. There were a good number of tents offering free samples. It was great to try food from several local places, since we got to discover new places to visit later. Unfortunately, none were selling food, so we couldn't also get lunch on the spot and had to go elsewhere for a full meal.

So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.\n\nWe started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.\n\nHowever, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.\n\nThen came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? \n\nRegardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read \"SWAG\" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.\n\n[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed \"Dolphin\" as one of its menu items. I asked in a slightly shocked voice if it was really dolphin, to which the server responded it was actually Mahi. 'Oh,' I responded. 'Then I'll have the veggie burger.' Because even in 1998 I was a food bitch.]","5":"review","6":"nc3cqVN0UuB3m50-CcMftw","7":"1","8":"4","9":"1"},{"0":"Lnohr9bpCbHNsomazXDg-w","1":"2011-07-12","2":"Jp1Qz-v1T8l26EPpYb7Iow","3":"1","4":"I waited 45min and ended up with a tiny gross little serving of tortilla with vegetable scraps thrown in it, served in a aluminum take-out box.

Naturally I expect a beer bar to have a relatively high volume but this place was ridiculously loud to the point of being annoying.\n\nThe beer selection was good though I'm not sure that makes up for the loudness and atmosphere that seemed a bit off: really brightly lit, and the decorating was of the signs-bought-new-but-made-to-look-old variety. Almost like a Bennigan's, kind of fakey-like. And why oh why does a place that specializes in beer and seats so many people have just a single urinal and single stall in the tiny men's bathroom? I hate standing in line to pee but than again maybe I'm just getting old :D (as an aside, obviously I have no experience using the women's so can't address that, sorry ladies)\n\nI'll try it again though.

We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case. \n\nMy fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.\n\nIt was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite.

It used to be good food with a friendly, attentive staff, but then they changed management. \n\nOur first experience with the new management and staff wasn't great.  Service was slow, but we figured they must be busy so we let it slide.  Then we bought stuff from the market.  They have two registers side-by-side--one for the market purchases and one for the restaurant bills. We went to the restaurant register so we could pay for our market purchases along with our meal.  First of all, we got ignored and had several customers taken before us, despite the fact that we were there first.  When they finally decided to acknowledge us, they told us we couldn't pay at that register since we had a market purchase.  Rather than just sliding over to the next register and taking care of the purchase there, they made us wait in line again.  Finally we checked out...and were overcharged.  We didn't realize this until we got home and by then it wasn't worth going back. \n\nWe decided to give them another chance and went back a few weeks later.  This time the service was even more slow. 15 minutes passed before we even got our water.  45 minutes later our food still hadn't arrived.  The waitress kept speeding by our table and ignoring us.  We snarfed our food down fast when it finally got there since we had to get back, and went to pay.  Long wait again as we got ignored for other customers who came after us, and then they overcharged us.  Again.  Fortunately we caught it this time.  They hastily made the correction, without so much as an apology.  Rather, they acted annoyed that we were holding them up.  How about getting it right the first time if you don't want to do it again? \n\nSo that was it.  I don't think we'll be going back.  It's really a shame, because the food is  delicious and this used to be one of our favorite places.  It's just a shame that the new staff sucks.  I can get good food elsewhere and not be treated like garbage and overcharged.","5":"review","6":"PlYBocPQMxzbDWLGIGAa4g","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"Ih1TGSZyu2Q8htn2JA4tIA","1":"2012-01-03","2":"hw7z9Y1Hvr9sXwKqUxMO3Q","3":"2","4":"I love German food, and as far as the food went at Bavarian Point, they had some good eats.

But the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service. It was bad enough that I wouldn't return, and certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. As others have noted, there was no-one to greet or seat us -- not even a sign saying \"seat yourself\". Our waitress took a LONG time to make it to our table to take our drink orders, and when she did, she was complaining about something and looked put-out in general. When my wife ordered a beer, the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasn't available on tap. Now, that could be useful information, but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful. Believe me, we gave her no reason to be so sour --  it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy -- whether with her job or life, it's hard to say.

After sinking lots of his own time into tinkering with it and $1000 to the awful Meineke down the street, he gave up... until my car's transmission went for good, and he decided to fix the Bird (yeah!) so I could drive it (yes, I am super lucky!)\n\nWhitey's diagnosed it as the carburetor dumping fuel (which is what Meineke charged $500 to replace.. hmmm...). Upon hearing the story of Meineke, Whitey's told him to order the part himself to avoid the markup and they'd put it in for just labor.  Awesome!\n\nWe took it home, but it wasn't running quite right still, and then failed emissions. Back to the shop it went.\n\nWhitey's took it back, spent ALL WEEKEND on it doing various minor things. At one point, they called and said \"We've done this, this and this, and it's still not quite right, so we're gonna keep it another day.\"   I was glad they were admitting they actually felt it to be not right and were determined to fix it, versus just handing it back again... but I was dreading the repair bill.\n\nWe picked it up Tuesday. The bill? $7. That's right - SEVEN DOLLARS. They only charged him for a spark plug and oil filter. That is amazing to me - I was expecting several hundred dollars for their time.  \n\nThe car runs beautifully now, and they were extremely pleasant the entire time. I'm taking my alleged defunct car to them for a second opinion next week.

Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now. \n\n     I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.\n\n     Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing true ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve. \n\n     Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza  \nBread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!","5":"review","6":"QiR2X306Yzd9fuJdKDhkGg","7":"3","8":"2","9":"2"},{"0":"uEJQSIjWui-TDWXaGlcqyQ","1":"2010-08-16","2":"BRHJDnT-kLosTfUWhRBQ_w","3":"4","4":"Being a fan of the infamous Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach, I was totally down for some chicken and waffles this morning.

So off we went...\n\nThe place is easy to find and pleasant to walk into. The staff was friendly immediately upon arrival. Service was quick and attentive. The menu is simple but appealing...so are the prices. We decided to go with the traditional chicken and waffle plates to satisfy the savory and sweet tooth.

Nails sanded too thin and they talk to other people and look away while they'e filing, sanding and cutting.  They cut two times now into the side of my thumb nail, which causes it to catch and tear off the same day, or soon.  Their 10 or 12-yr old daughter brought the colors to pick (she is much too precocous to be customer focused--she's narcisstic and I want an adult waiting on me).  They have to open bottles to look at gel color--no samples.  Gel drying machine is sitting on a priority mail box on top of chair in customer wait area.   Pedicure okay.  Won't come back.  This place like many with Vietnamese want your money, they don't understand service (or cleanliness in this one) and why we really come to these places.  They also try and nickle and dime you on price, for instance give you a deal to take off gel from previous manicure, when you're getting a new gel manicure.  They want to use the dremel to sand your nails down to the quick.  How about healthy nails and return visit.  This place I'm surprised stays in business.  Sadly it's not in a category by itself although the others are cleaner.  Jimmy should stay away from nails and customers, and just keep quiet.  The girl might be cute to some customers but I am not coming to have a 12-year old wait on me.

I've been here several times for breakfast and lunch, and have never been disappointed. They have the BEST eggs!  I also love the layout and of course, the free wifi. August is their \"Burger Daze\", a different burger every day for the entire month. Today's burger was the wasabi burger, and being a fan of foods with kick, I was thinking about this burger since yesterday. It almost makes me cry to say I was underwhelmed by it. It was a burger with a creamy horseradishy sauce on it, and you got a little wasabi flavor, but it lacked that kick you get from eating wasabi. It also had an Asian salad mixture on the burger as well. Don't get me wrong, it was tasty, but when I think that I paid $11 for that and a side of potato chips, I feel a little slighted. If you eat ten of their burgers over the course of the month you can get a $25 gift card (save your receipts). The burger just wasn't good enough to get me to come back 9 more times this month.  \n\nI'll definitely return to Liberty Market again- as I said I do love the restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to eat. However I think I'll stick to their breakfasts and other sandwiches.

We browsed the racks of vintage clothing and costume jewelry before sitting down at the bar. It was difficult to choose our milkshake flavor, given the dizzying array of syrups and ice cream combos, but after settling on chocolate and wild cherry, we were very pleased. Plus it was a cheerful looking thing, topped with whipped cream, colorful sprinkles, and a cherry.\nI was not as pleased with the service... it wasn't busy until after we sat down, but no one took our order or even gave us a menu or a \"hello\" until we'd been sitting for about 10 minutes. A party of 8 or so, including a bunch of indecisive kids, sat down AFTER us, and were served before my sister and I... and no acknowledgement of the wait. While we waited, I did enjoy looking at all the cool decor from the past, though I think the whole place could be a little bit cleaner.","5":"review","6":"x46c5z1ldZHuYcLlrIf1nA","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"7fdAFixba3JDk0pCCiAx8w","1":"2011-07-16","2":"PO6P1STqxLYNePwM4kvTUg","3":"5","4":"Had a late night plumbing emergency last night.

The price they charged me for the after hours repair was the most reasonable ever. Last but not least he was a heck of a nice guy.

My favorite was the \"Turning Japanese\" which was like biting into a vodka infused pear.\n\nService at the bar was wonderful - Victoria is the one of the cutest bartenders in Old Town (guys, go pay her a visit). Drinks were flowing and the food came out quickly.\n\nIn addition to the happy hour and Victoria, make sure you check out their restrooms and private karaoke rooms, complete with \"entertainment\" poles.

We had lunch at Nourish a few months ago and while we weren't overly impressed, as they do serve healthy food that is in line with our whole foods, plant-based eating habits, we decided to give them another shot and went for brunch a few weekends ago.  I ordered the egg sandwich, which is described as an air-fried egg, avocado, and tomato on a gluten free bagel with a side of sweet potato hash.  As I have never found gluten free bread products to be very mouth-watering, I asked to substitute multi-grain bread in place of the bagel, as the bread had previously been the best part of the lunch sandwich that I'd had.  The server informed me that they were out of bread (how does a restaurant run out of bread when half of their menu items are sandwiches? very poor planning by management) and that the only other item available was a wheat bun, which I opted for.  My husband ordered the veggie quiche, which is described as zucchini, asparagus, caramelized onion, parmesan, and a quinoa crust. \n\nAfter an incredibly long wait (the restaurant was less than 1/3 full), our food finally arrived.  My egg sandwich was by far the most flavorless breakfast item I have ever consumed.  The air-fried egg had sounded appealing as it would be healthy and not greasy, which was the case, however I didn't realize that this also meant there would be absolutely no seasoning on it or flavor to it at all.  The sweet potato hash was downright disgusting and I only consumed a cube or two of the mushy, flavorless heap that was on my plate.  As bad as my meal was, my husband's veggie quiche definitely won the award for worst breakfast item ever tasted.  The \"quinoa crust\" which we were looking forward to as we love quinoa dishes, was actually undercooked quinoa mixed throughout the entire quiche with no visible crust present, which gave the whole thing a granular texture equivalent to fine gravel having been poured into the dish.  The vegetables almost appeared to be ground up as there was just an overall green appearance to the egg portion with no discernible pieces of the veggies described on the menu actually present.  The dish in general had a strange taste and the off-putting texture from the quinoa was more than I could handle even in just the one bite that I tasted.  I honestly don't know how my husband even managed to choke down the portion of the quiche that he did.\n\nWe also each had two bloody marys while we were there and while each took an incredibly long time to get, the first one was flavorful and seemed to be made \"extra spicy\" as we requested, however, the second one was flavorless and tasted like watered down tomato juice.  While Nourish has a nice patio and offers a view of the lush foliage present in the complex, these elements are not enough to bring us back after we left with our tastebuds reeling in horror over the flavors, or lack thereof, of our brunch.","5":"review","6":"2qnz2y_Z1nDo2HqqfxJxSA","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"4eFIVmbeCvJGCrhzmd-VYA","1":"2010-03-19","2":"hlA2F8tM4UpeIq7Zy9EQ9A","3":"5","4":"I would be beside myself if Grinders closed. It's about time I wrote a review, since I'm a regular. I can be found sitting on one of the giant chairs surfing on the wi-fi many mornings.\n\nI'm the one who brought the plants in. I used to water them a couple times a week but nowadays I'm lazy and they really need to be repotted. I should get on that ...\n\nThe music is always playing and everyone knows my regular drink ... they've continued to memorize it for me even as I started to slowly decrease the fat & calories of my regular order. Now it's an ice skim latte with sugar free vanilla. I used to get an Everything bagel with egg, cheese and potatoes most mornings. Now I get it on multigrain toast. Eh, it's the little things.\n\nThe coffee at Grinders is really really good. It's not bitter and sharp, it's smooth. They grind their beans outside many mornings per week. Sometimes it gets too warm inside during the winter so we prop the doors open, but if the grinder is going outside, it'll blow coffee bean fumes in the door.\n\nThere's some retired motorcycle cops who meet up every morning and sit around the big round table. They often park their motorcycles in front of the place together. They call themselves the Geezerados.\n\nThere's sometimes a few right-wingers having conversations mid-day. One time I listened to their meeting and heard them trying to come up with controversial topics to get people to come to church. They spent a long time trying to figure out who could get them proof that global warming isn't happening, so they could use that as their hook.\n\nA lot of moms come in with their kids. Seeing siblings piled up in one of the oversized chairs together is common. There are a few regulars who come in specifically to sit on the internet all day. I'm not there all day, but I'm there at all times of the day because I have a home office, and you never know when you suddenly need caffeine.\n\nEarly in the morning and after 3pm the place becomes flooded with Sunnyslope High School kids. They range from ROTC kids wearing pickle suits to trendy girls in neon to the alternative crowd. They often lay around the couch splayed across each other or gazing into each others' eyes. \n\nOrdinarily I'm a real talker and I can't usually keep my mouth shut, but Grinders is the one place that I go where I barely make a peep. I just eavesdrop on everyone's conversations and sometimes run into friends I know. I usually go before my brain is fully awake in the morning, that's part of it. For the record, a couple months ago one of the girls there said I was practically invisible and she hardly knew I was there, because I was so quiet.\n\nThere's nothing pretentious about Grinders at all, and it's also down to earth without being ghetto. It has character. Some months the art is better than other months. Hannah has been there for years (they call her Big Hannah now, only because there's another girl named Hannah who is tiny and they call her Little Hannah) and Hannah rocks and makes the best breakfast ever. \n\nI can ride my bike in the morning and be wearing my pajamas and not have anyone really bat an eye. That's the beauty of Grinders. I've seen other people come in wearing their pajamas, too. It's a little bit like the cafeteria in a college dorm, except the people are of all ages and we live down the street from each other instead of down the hall from each other.\n\nGrinders has a location inside the John C. Lincoln hospital across the street, too. It's common to see the hospital workers walk in wearing their scrubs. I think they're also opening one at Devry, or they just did. I was frustrated to hear that they tried to open a location at the Art Institute but they were one week too late, Stupid Starbucks had just gotten there.

I couldn't see her headset so I thought she was speaking to me, but obviously she wasn't. In fact, she never looked at me during the lightning fast manicure, except in confusion when I said I didn't want her to cut my cuticles -- just push them back. She really didn't understand that, and asked me in broken English why I was getting a manicure but not getting my cuticles cut. She didn't have an attitude about it, but was just really confused. I think after that exchange, she told whoever was on her phone about it.\n\nI also thought it was strange that she asked me to wash my hands after giving me a lotioned hand massage -- sort of defeats the purpose of applying lotion to my hands in the first place? \n\nThe whole experience was perfunctory, but didn't leave me wanting to return for a manicure. Not asking for a great nail technician, but it would have been nice if she acknowledged my existence other than doing my nails, and most importantly if she asked whether I wanted them cut round or square because I wanted them round!  I would have interrupted her phone conversation to let her know my preference, but she was so fast to dunk my hands back into the soaking dish that I didn't see what they looked like!","5":"review","6":"2ARM6NFVciTzV21r7p8jiw","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"O-Xa9GCFWI65YiBD5Jw_hA","1":"2012-07-03","2":"748rZWrS3ZR4xhhvfGJUcg","3":"5","4":"In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.

Bass Pro Shops is an outdoor person's dream. \n\nAnd it's good for the whole family, oddly enough!\n\nOnce you get inside this massive place, you have an upstairs and downstairs. There is a kid's area, a restaurant with fresh fish, a huge women's section and mens, and areas for fishing and boats and hunting and camping and survival and gear for any occasion. You can look at the giant fish tank, climb up a faux rock side for $3, and just be purely entertained for ages. They have snack foods and jerky and sweets. BBQ grills. Do they have guns? I don't know, probably! They have GPS equipment and water bottles and on and on and on. \n\nIt was exhausting in a great way. My camping/outdoors needs tend to be more mimimalist oriented so I prefer an REI. But I like it here a lot.

Just came back from a week in Maui, so I was still in \"Hawaii-Mode\" (which is soooo hard to get out of lol), so I insisted we go to Hula's to get my Hawaii fix.  Mainly....that just means I was dying for a good Mai Tai.\n\nIf you go here, you MUST order a Mai Tai.  While most of their drinks are pretty good and tropical tasting, the Mai Tai is the best in town (now that Trader Vic's is donzo).  I'm a Mai tai snob, and cringe when most mai tai's here on the mainland are made way way way too sweet and fruity.  The Mai Tai at Hula's could rival some of the best in Hawaii in my opinion.  Mostly rum (white and dark) and just the right amount of sweet mixed with the right amount of tart/sour.  They go down great and they hit you with quite the kick before ya know it, so be careful ;-)!\n\nAs far as the food...its good, but its not Roy's so don't except anything amazing.  I usually get fish here, just to go with the whole Hawaiian thing.  Most of the times I've had Mahi, it can be dry sometimes, but always tastes good.  Ive had both the wasabi crusted and the macadamia nut crusted, both are decent.  The Luau Pork plate is darn good, but my recommendation is get the Luau Pork sandwich instead.  It goes so much better on bread, than just by itself.  All the appetizers are great to munch on while you're enjoying your Mai Tai...all thats missing is Hawaiian music, and the sun setting over the ocean :)","5":"review","6":"omuO9FVYAVRTybkSc4a4fw","7":"0","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"J-c25QK8xBqv1P-huUkoTQ","1":"2010-08-27","2":"nAJ0HvYhoUjo5wKMewK7iA","3":"5","4":"I LOVE Laser for Less (Chandler)!  If you are going anywhere else for Laser hair removal you need to stop now and call to make an appointment with Laser for Less, Chandler.   I wasted a lot of $$$ at another Laser removal place before I found Laser for Less and now I am kicking myself for not going to them first.  If you pay to wax any part of your body you should be lasering that hair off.  It works better, lasts longer, and in the long run is cheaper.  \n\nPros - \n1. Free touch ups 14-18 days after your first appointment if they missed 1 hair they will touch up for free.  Never had a problem with them discouraging me, in fact it was the opposite they give me reminder cards so I know when my touch ups are due.  They encourage you to come in.\n2. They can also charge you by the laser shot instead of a whole area.  So if you only have a few random hairs they will just charge 10 cent per shot on the legs or 70 cents on the face or smaller areas.  You can't beat that deal.\n3. I am pretty sure they beat or match all prices in town.\n4. Once they laser the hair, all your hair will fall out and wont grow back for like 2 months, its better than waxing.  Not all laser removal places use the type of laser that does this place does.  That is why I recommend them, it works a lot better!\n5. They actually care about getting rid of unwanted hair and will go over all their policies with you.  Kristen is who I go to and she is great.  I have been to almost all their girls and they are good. \n6. In fact when it was my birthday month I didn't know I got some discount and they back credited me for it, I feel like they are always trying to get me the best deal.  \n7. They always have deals.  Just last month they had their underarm extravaganza where you can get your underarms done for $30!!! That is so cheap.  They let you buy up to 3 sessions.  I referred a friend and she loved it so much because she didn't have to shave her underarms the WHOLE summer.  \n8.

We got lost and ended trail busting which is highly discouraged but give us rules and we will break  em. During our run back down the trail I took a pretty hard fall face planting into the dirt, stabbing my right hand into a rock and banging up my knee. No broken bones or teeth, thankfully. We had just passed a couple of hikers when I took the fall so they saw everything. I laid there for about 10 seconds, jumped back up, noticed the blood, my torn tee and just continued on with the hike. We came across a park ranger who was standing outside his truck and asked if he had any medical supplies. Unfortunately, his first aid kit was about 20 years old and didn't contain anything that would help any of my wounds. We found a CVS on our way home and picked up some medical supplies and my wounds were washed and bandaged in the parking lot. \n\nProbably my most memorable hike thus far.","5":"review","6":"4lkTIhTuMhLprQprGlTRlA","7":"2","8":"2","9":"2"},{"0":"duHUQFn7K-Ybs1rPI4AOEQ","1":"2012-04-21","2":"-mx37da3WjhatYeOMqz9DA","3":"5","4":"Excellent service and food.

We ate on the patio, which is directly on Central Avenue, and after the horrid smell of grease & exhaust pipes, I couldn't wait to flee the scene.\n\nLast year, I was unknowingly led back to this same place.  Years had passed, and I had completely forgotten about my vow to never return. This time, I was pleased.\n\nIt probably helps that upon entering my expectations were very low. I immediately was attracted to the kitschy Mexican artwork, their vast tequila collection on display, and of course, the christmas lights.\n\nThe salsa seemed fresh and was just the right amount of spice. They keep the chips & salsa flowing so be careful not to fill up.  The margaritas are really sweet, but they're cheap and will get the job done.\n\nThis is the kind of place where you stick to basics. Don't get fancy or try and order something healthy.  Get a chimichanga, burrito,  shrimp enchiladas, or a chile relleno, and if it's appropriate, get that sucker enchilada style. Be sure to have your Tums handy when done if you think you can eat a whole plate by yourself.\n\nThe portions are huge and totally splitable.  Oh, last word of advice, don't get the guacamole. It's super gringo, and has a ton of sour cream in it.\n\nI'm giving this place 3 stars b/c it's a good value if you're sharing, they ambiance is very comfortable & amusing, and the service is very accommodating.","5":"review","6":"jt8jtEY1K6TD1FBzYa7HGw","7":"0","8":"2","9":"2"},{"0":"9dopZKjYiKwPiw7kEQsEag","1":"2012-08-29","2":"350wZFK1W9Hz1e9b-On3Hg","3":"3","4":"Sooo...if they ask you if you want to sit in the 'lounge'...just say no!

Due to its lack of windows and barebones facade, I concluded that this bar had the possibility of being the sort of place where, when I opened the door, I might bare witness to a mob boss or two trying to decide what they should do with the man they just shot...  but that wasn't the case.\n\nWhat I discovered was a long corridor flanked by mirrored walls and strings of multicolored lights, as well as ample seating and classic video games to boot.  The games included PacMan and Golden Tee, accompanied by a dartboard and a pool table - enough to keep the gamer in any of us busy for at least a few hours of drink-sippin.\n\nThe drinks were cheap and strong, and the tunes were decent - however the digital jukebox put a frown on my face; I hoped for a Wurlitzer.  Our barkeep was friendly and efficient, and our drinks were strong and low-priced.  I think tap beer's only two bucks, and mixers aren't too much more.\n\nIn conclusion, the next time you're feeling a bit nostalgic, and you're looking for a watering hole off the beaten path, kick a few back at the Roadrunner.

The chef was in the food window expediting food, making sure it went out promptly and correctly.

I like to try to stay positive though so here is my attempt a the proverbial \"positive sandwich\"\n\nTop Bun: The location is fantastic. I really like where it is, its a cute little place that is very easy to find.\n\nThe Meat of the Matter: The food here is odd. I am very open to trying new things and experiencing different cultures. As I have mentioned in other reviews, I love all types of food from all over the world. I didn't care for this place. I ordered an appetizer that was wrapped in a banana leaf and i honestly thought I was eating an ashtray. It wasn't good. The pad thai that I sampled was very lifeless. I had a friend get a big bowl of soup that looked good but i didn't try it. \n\nLettuce, onions pickles, tomato: The service was not good. I sat at the bar the first time I went here and we got ignored for the most part. The bartender (who i believe doesn't work there anymore, luckily) sniffed at me when I asked for clarification on something. There are also jars of really weird floating things at the bar (probably pickled/preserved veggies/meat/fruits etc.) it was unappetizing to be around....I don't have a weak stomach at all, it was just odd. The second time I went in, the service was equally as bad. there was a table of 8 of us for lunch and the place was mostly dead and I had to go up and ask them to take our order after we sat waiting for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the menu is small and the prices are high with not much room for substitutions or changes\n\nBottom bun: I like the owner, he is really nice and friendly. The cooks were also friendly. I like to believe that my taste buds merely didn't care for this place. I know a lot of people that have very positive things to say about this place. I will not recommend it as a personal favorite and I will quite frankly probably avoid it unless it is specifically requested by a client. I am completely fine with the concept that not everyone has to like the same things.

The music was at a decent level, but for some reason, the place is just REALLY loud. \n\nAnd finally, and this is just a matter of personal preference, I'm not a fan of the seating arrangement. It's set up in a way so that you are rubbing elbows with other parties and unable to avoid being all up in their kool-aid... \n\nPOSITIVE: \n\nFor the moment, I'm still alive (which feels like a negative right now, but I'm hoping that this current wave of nausea will be the last).","5":"review","6":"2KNPtV5E44vAiEr5BvMkUA","7":"3","8":"2","9":"4"},{"0":"e1TRaM2GZq8qBFogZaNklw","1":"2012-08-22","2":"cHiH_DWMj_nrXiUR31kexA","3":"3","4":"Like many of my fellow Yelpers, I too take issue with the ladies at the MAC counter, but not necessarily Nordstrom's as the \"store.\"  After using my pressed powder compact to the point of \"crumbs,\" I prepared for battle and a trip to the mall.

As the restaurant is often empty, Julia though it would be good to give them some business...but in the end it was our group that ended up being given the business. The words highway robbery come to mind, but I guess we weren't really on the highway. The prices listed on the menu really didn't seem that out of line, a bit on the pricey side but nothing alarming. Our waitress slyly sold us a kazillion dollars worth of appetizers that were not on the menu. We got 4 plates which consisted of 4 individual sauces with some stuff in them...one had shrimp, one had chicken, one had pork, and one had chihuahua. Oh wait, I think that was the cheese on top. Anyway, the plate with 4 tablespoons of sauce was not worth the $25...oh wait, we got 4 of them. The waitress also managed to slip two orders of guacamole in on us for $11 a piece. As far as the entrees are concerned, the portions were small and the food was kind of meh. The mole was way too sweet for my taste. The biggest bummer of all was NO BOOZE! The $120 worth of appetizers would have gone over much better if they were washed down with some frosty margaritas. A couple of pitchers and they could have slipped us some $100 flan.\n\nRegardless of the price and the mediocre food, it was well worth going for the amazing company of the awesome Phoenix Yelpers.

I had to dig deep to exercise my self-control and not demolish the entire bag in one sitting!\n\nI took a menu to go as well, and now as I look at it, I can't wait to go back to try more of the unique gourmet popcorn flavors.  Not only do they have the basics (Buttery and Low Salt), but they have all kinds of savory flavors including several different cheeses, Dill Pickle, Salt & Vinegar, and Southwest Jalapeno.  If you're more of a Caramel person, they've got you covered as well, and of course there are a rainbow of Fruity Delights and Decadent Chocolate flavors too!  Popcorn Bags come in all sizes from Mini to Party and range in price from $1 to $149.95.  You can also order tins, boxes, and/or pots of popcorn and this place ships anywhere in the U.S.A.\n\nCongrats on your Grand Opening, My Popcorn Kitchen.  Let the popcorn parties begin!","5":"review","6":"fczQCSmaWF78toLEmb0Zsw","7":"12","8":"12","9":"6"},{"0":"ut-kla-EA23nJOij_dcL0Q","1":"2008-10-04","2":"HGlLM4J1U-xJBgP1-_jmXA","3":"3","4":"Maybe I'm being generous, but CPK is an okay place for unique pizza. I've always enjoyed their Santa Fe pizza, but this time I thought I'd try their Greek pizza. It was o-k. Nothing special. Too many veggies, without enough meat, cheese and Tzatziki sauce to counter-balance it. \n\nWhat really bothered me was that they sat my sister and me right behind the kitchen. I don't think they should even have a table right there. I saw everything that was going on in there. Plus, I kept hearing the servers complaining to their boss about shit. One girl was saying something about another server \"not liking her.\" I felt like I was in a high school cafeteria. And, to top it off, it was FREEZING in there. It is never a good idea to have it soooo cold, that your patrons want to get the hell out of there to warm up!\n\nBut, besides my few complaints, it is a fine establishment, although it could definitely improve. I'm sure I'll go back again. But, maybe the next time,I'll stick with my old stand by -- the Santa Fe.","5":"review","6":"oIVsVM8H273aoT1JUmsDIg","7":"2","8":"4","9":"1"},{"0":"UL3OMN_c-NXHlyb97pDifA","1":"2010-05-13","2":"soA1xb5ug18f0Mb_sDwaVQ","3":"4","4":"This was another stop on our pub crawl and I only had one drink here so I don't have too much to go by for rating, but they had a nice selection and the cider realler hit the spot.

The vanilla was okay, the cinnamon was dry and chalky and I really disliked it.\n\n- This place is a disorganized mess. \n\n- There is no rhyme or reason to any of the ordering process. My friends and I were carefully watching the ordering process and we actually think they decided to choose the dumbest and most irrational methods to take orders and dispense cupcakes. Just stupid.\n\n- The owners must have purposely only hired people who cannot think for themselves or make decisions. No sane person could possibly work here without being like \"um...there might be a better way to do this...\"\n\n- Also, the employees were rude. Did I mention dumb?\n\nSo get this: I attempted to order a bottle of water. I told the clerk it's 100+ degrees outside, I walked there and I'm realllllllly thirsty. The idiot at the counter told me \"You can order a water here but you must wait for your name to be called to receive the water and pay for it.\" I pointed out that the water was RIGHT THERE and there wasn't anyone currently paying or using the register. Couldn't she just sell me a water? She said \"NO\" and proceeded to WRITE DOWN MY ORDER (just the word \"water\") on a cupcake order slip. She then told me to stand there and wait for my name to be called so she could HAND ME THE WATER and then ring me up.\n\nI was all sorts of thirsty and all sorts of moody that day so I got really ghetto on her ass and was all like OH HELLLLLL-TO-THE-NO!\" \n\nI said \"It's quite simple. Just hand me the water and I will hand you money. End of discussion.\" (There are the actual words out of the mouth!)\n\nShe looked really mad and also possibly terrified of me and my 5'4\" 110 lbs of fury. Thankfully she handed me my water so I did not have to stab her. Which was good because I was waaaaaaaaay too thirsty to stab anyone. \n\nI must be properly hydrated in order to commit crimes of passion.

The spunky chipotle dressing is delish.  There are also several lunch-sized versions of dinner plates available for diners looking for a heartier meal.

There were mimosas waiting for us. \nThe class started with introductions to the variuos Thai cooking ingredients. I found this information so interesting. How do you know which fish sauce to buy, what the different pastes smell and taste like, how to grow your own Lemongrass and so much more. \nWe started by making Siamese Kisses. It was all hands on and really fun. The next was a fresh red curry paste. Then we compared the fresh to the store bought brand. What a difference!\nThe Arizona Heatwave was next. So Delish. The final dish was Asian Pumpkin Custard.\nWe tasted everything along the way and then they served us HUGE portions of the items for lunch with a Champange paring.\nThe Chamange paring was also very informative and the pours were never ending.

They are friendly in their own unique kind of way. Because I usually saunter in with a drink from Starbucks (same parking lot), the female owner assumes I work there and she always asks me how business is going at SB. I corrected her the first few times, but she continued to ask, so now I just keep it going and tell her it's going great but that I hate my job (because I'm assuming I would, if I worked there).

They are caring and wonderful with my dogs.  They are never too busy to smile and give great service when I come through the door.  They have even taken time to share stories and pictures of their own pets.\n\nSecond, they understand that some people must take a fiscally conservative approach with the care of their pets.  They discussed all options thoroughly with me and I performed the care that was needed a little at a time -- as it was needed.  This was important to me since many vets that we've visited in the past have handed us an estimate for hundreds or thousands of dollars and wouldn't budge -- insisting that we HAD to do ALL the work listed.  At QC Vet Clinic, I didn't feel like I was judged for that decision.\n\nUnfortunately, we had a small mistake that I discussed with the vet.  She listened and gave appropriate feedback to my concerns.  This is really the only thing that is preventing a 5 star rating.  Overall they are still the best vet I've visited and I will continue to put my pets lives in their very capable hands.\n\nBTW, we had to have a pet put down because he was ill. The team at QC Vet Clinic was absolutely the best!  They were so empathetic and even sent us a sympathy card with a little surprise inside... I won't give it away, but it was so very special to my family.

It doesn't matter because it was worth the trip.  I ordered pick up because I was by myself and wanted to a bit of exploring.  The place has a nice casual ambiance.  They also have an outdoor seating area.  I ordered the pad thai that comes with chicken and shrimp as a standard.  Since it was lunch time, it was part of the lunch menu that came with a choice of soup or salad.  I chose the soup, but was too stuffed to have it because I jumped right into the pad thai.  I ordered it medium spicy, and it was pretty spicy.  I can't imagine what hot would have tasted like.  Actually, I'm more curious of what it would have tasted like in a mild flavor.  The noodles were slightly overcooked, but still flavorful.  I also had the Thai Iced Tea here, and it was perfect for the weather and a great combination with the tangy pad thai flavor.  The prices are expensive compared to Chicago, but I hear it's typical for Phoenix/Scottsdale area.  My lunch speciai and drink costed me a little over $15.  I guess if you are craving it that bad like I was, you'll pay the price...","5":"review","6":"jfXT_8J_EQnJVa4sJ3z6hg","7":"2","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"5weJ3DRKwvQ9claomkYq9w","1":"2011-07-21","2":"rqfTcaa2IvVUfeXituCqoA","3":"4","4":"I am a little finicky with pizza.

The menu now has a disclaimer saying that some sides may incur an additional charge.  That was two of my gripes on my first visit, so check and check.. \n\nThis time, I ordered an 8pc with 2 large sides...As stated above, chicken was bigger, and it was hot and moist..perfectly seasoned. For sides, I ordered the sweet corn nuggets and mac and cheese. They had run out of mac and cheese and had to make more. It took about 10 minutes to make. Was it worth the wait? It was fresh, REAL macaroni and cheese, baked in the oven, not some \"out of the box\" variety. It was made with real cheese, as witnessed by the stringy cheese when eaten. My comment here is that I prefer a more creamy variety than what it was. But it definitely was better than Kraft mac & cheese in a box. \n\nThe sweet corn nuggets were incredible. Not sure if they are something they make fresh or if it comes out of a freezer bag, but they were delicious little morsels. Nuggets of corn kernals, surrounded by a light crunchy coating and deep fried. \n\nI wanted to try out their fried shrimp, so I got an \"add on\" of 4 fried shrimp ($1.99). At first view, I was disappointed. What I got were 4 very small (think MAYBE 45-50 sized shrimp). They were not even butterflied, which would have made them appear bigger). But upon tasting them, I really enjoyed the flavor. They appeared to be freshly breaded (is it the same seasoned flour used for the chicken?) and were very tasty. My suggestion here would be to 1) butterfly the shrimp and 2) get a slightly larger shrimp (even if it means a price increase).\n \nWith my second trip to LFC, I am becoming an even bigger fan..Tasty chicken, good sides, a clean restaurant, and nice employees.","5":"review","6":"cFoiVWF42HSXQEtqxDvdWQ","7":"1","8":"1","9":"1"},{"0":"duHUQFn7K-Ybs1rPI4AOEQ","1":"2011-02-18","2":"oaZpNjMgTYOaiAJ1I17zyQ","3":"4","4":"Attention margarita lovers- you MUST order the Chambord Margarita.

My wife & I went with 2 other foodie couples, who are good friends, for our monthly \"side dish\" function.  The food was all fantastic.  All 5 of the other people in our group were drinking martinis, which they all said were very tasty as well, but at $12-$16 per, I'm a little put off.  I'm more of a beer guy anyway, so I had a couple of craft-brews that are not available everywhere, and then settled on a Firestone DBA -- a very very tasty beer -- and had several of those.  Great food, great booze, club music atmosphere is pretty cool. Outdoor area is excellent. Felt like an idiot when I had to ask where the mens room was only to turn around and find that the huge wall of a door was right behind me and said \"he\" in huge letters on the bottom of the door.  Oh and then (6 or 7 strong beers into the evening) I found that the mirror next to the (only) urinal in the mens room misled me into believing there was a second urinal, which I tried unsuccessfully to walk to.  Why is that guy walking directly toward me?  Oh, it's me.  In the mirror. Dumbass.  So then (after relieving myself in the actual urinal) I go back out to the table to tell the story about trying to use the urinal in the mens room that doens't exist, and somebody else says \"yeah the same fucking thing happened to me too!\" so I don't feel like such a dumbass anymore.

Ringo likes to sniff small dogs.

Now my 18 fans are stuck with my incredibly less witty new review.\n\nBelieve it or not, I actually had not been to Sprinkles in well over a year.  Unbelievable, I know, considering I live close by.  Maybe that says something.  Something along the lines of I'm not really anxious to pay more for a single cupcake than it costs me to make a dozen or two at home.  But what do you do when it's August and the thought of adding any more heat to the kitchen just won't do, and yet you really need a cupcake?  Well, you go stand in a line 12 deep to pay $14 for 4 cupcakes.\n\nI've been to Sprinkles maybe 4 times now, and they've been pretty consistent.  I do like their frosting, but I find the cake to be somewhat dry and flavorless IMO.  And I'm always surprised by the line here.  Are people that much in love with Sprinkles, or is it that most of the population is not able to read the directions on a Betty Crocker box?  I'm not saying Sprinkles is bad.  It certainly has its place in my life for a cupcake fix, particularly when I know if I make 12, I'll eat 12.  But I wouldn't go so far as to say I'm a fan.  Unless they lower their price to $1, then I'll be their biggest fan.","5":"review","6":"wHg1YkCzdZq9WBJOTRgxHQ","7":"7","8":"8","9":"9"},{"0":"Bc5bgPG1MlTc75G0A-_7fg","1":"2006-02-09","2":"-EddE6xa2YBdiBllClqZ7w","3":"4","4":"A perfect way to top of an exotic shopping experience at 99 Ranch.

So much so that I'm buying a dining room table, additional gear for the kitchen and not frequenting any chain while I'm in my hometown based on the strength of this experience. Even in a good mood this place wouldn't be breaking a 2.5 . I'm not in a good mood.  \n\nTexas cheese fries. Pretty tasteless,mess of uncrisp steak fries that are meant to be Monterrey jack , cheddar and bacon. Either the cheese mixed itself together really well or that's not what I had. Bacon , mm that is a very generous term for the toe nail clippings of meat that ended up atop it. Saving grace was only ordering 1/2 an order.\n\nKid's meal.  Holy crap dried and scraggly carrots accompanied the most basic hot dog imaginable on the most generic bun. No refill offered this time on drink, no straw either.   By far the most cynical  kid's meal I've met. Sure make a profit but don't take the piss!  Fresh carrots are not hard to do , with white film on them.. sorry you've just earned a  1 star. Should have walked out, didn't. :( \n\nEntrees.\n\nCajun steak . Claims to be marinated in spices that I couldn't find. They may indeed have shown them a picture of the process in the recipe but I couldn't find it. Meant to be medium rare but was medium on one side , rare on the other, close though:) \n\nSirloin steak. Cooked as requested , a bit over seasoned. \n\nSides: Twice baked potato.  If you ever want to open up a salt mine these guy will do it for you. You want an idea of what it's texture was?  Twice chewed would be a better name. Warm vomit with bacon bits would be  a slightly more colorful, and chunky, term.\n\nFried onions:   came with whatever was stuck to the grill they came from.The mushrooms were the only thing that were as tasteful as expected. They looked very consistent though,  canned?   Never mind they were edible: \n\nSteak soup,really more a stew,but tasted pretty good.  Overall service was ok'ish but walking the kid to the toilet twice the staff just seemed  to want to get to where they wanted to go and not care for the toddler walking up the aisle to the restroom in front of me.  ( that's for this occasion only , past two times it's been great fun for the kid,)\n\n1.5 rounded to 1 for the carrots.","5":"review","6":"N3L6SDymSRkYQtTiSDmXSg","7":"1","8":"3","9":"4"},{"0":"AqbgC7Gul5Es1rRzGNLDFA","1":"2010-04-03","2":"COXIY5Om_HoDABhaZ-30UA","3":"3","4":"I'm not a woman and I don't read People magazines at the gym so I'm not sure I'm really the qualified demo for this place.

Especially the vanilla.\n\nI'd give this place a better review but I don't because I consider the cupcake to be the \"Rodney Dangerfield\" of desserts.

We came here after going to Chelsea's Kitchen down the street which was super packed for the night.  I easily get annoyed with complementary valet parking because I hardly ever carry cash and feel weird if I do not tip the valet boys and girls but I digress....\n\nThe concept and look of this place is really fun and different.  I felt like I was in a modern barn.  We walked in and put our name on the list and was surprised that it is all done by an i-Pad and you receive a text message when your table is ready.  Good thing the bf and I remembered our phones or else we would have been out of luck.  The wait wasn't horrible.  We went to the bar and got a couple of glasses of wine, the bartenders didn't seem really in a hurry to help us which got me a little annoyed.\n\nWe were seated in a cozy, and I mean cozy 2 top table right in a main traffic way.  My bf and I are not big people and felt uncomfortable in the size of the table.  I know you want to pack a lot of tables in a small space but at the expense of the customer?  Our waiter was friendly enough but not as friendly as he was to the group of women that was seated next to us.... nothing like treating all your tables equal huh?\n\nWe ordered an appetizer, the zucca chips, which had a decent flavor but were a little burnt.  We ordered out main dishes which were a chicken dish and their version of spaghetti and meatballs.  The wait for the food wasn't bad either but I hate when you as the customer have to ask for a wine list because your wine was empty for 10 minutes but the waiter didn't ask if you wanted anything else because he was focused on the table of 5 women next to us sharing an appetizer.  \n\nI had the pasta and meatballs, which was me'h.  The pasta was a little mushy and the meatballs really didnt have much flavor.  My bf had the chicken dish with spinach which he loved!  All in all the experience wasn't bad but wasn't good.

This place is a gold mine if you're a whiskey drinker, my hottie loves some good whiskey and was really impressed with their selection... not to mention he said the burger was probably the best he'd had.  I can't wait to get a taste of their Veggie burger, but I haven't gone hungry enough yet... Next time for sure!

Everything about this place is fabulous. The server was extremely attentive, the food was fresh and delicious, and the intimate yet casual ambiance is to die for.\n\nENTREE\n\nFor starters, they do put a rather unique spin on the typical 'chips and salsa' that's brought out to you in the beginning of most Spanish restaurants. They bake corn tortillas until their crisp and serve that with an interesting array of dips: black bean, salsa, and a tray of salt, limes, and hot sauce to stir in.\n\nI ordered a simple entree of carne asada tacos and black beans; my meal was yummy and filling, and I even had leftovers. Beware of spicy when choosing your dish, however. My coworker kept complaining about how hot her meal was (beer battered fish burrito). I don't know if she has sensitive taste buds, or if it was really spicy.. so proceed with caution.\n\nDESSERT\n\nThey have a wide variety of entrees, but unfortunately only have 3 sweet options. I'm a BIG dessert person, so it was a little disappointing but what the heck. I ordered the flan and it was scrumptious, incredible, delectable, etc.. all that good stuff. My coworker who complained about the spiciness called our dessert 'sexy'. So I guess sexy is the best way to describe it's caramel drizzle and chocolate bark yumminess.\n\nAMBIANCE/SERVICE\n\nThe waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. He answered all questions we had, and gave speedy and praiseworthy service. The manager even came up to our table and made conversation; that, to me, is always a plus. The background music helped add to the overall appeal to the restaurant. \n\nI would definitely go back to SOL.

They're always running a deal, so look for one before departing.  One year we did an annual pass.  It was a good deal.  There are also lots of special events that include deals.  One time we met spiderman.\n\nThere are lots of rides, mostly for shorter kids.  Some have modest height requirement that exclude the very young and some that exclude the tall.  There's a train, carousel, mini-coaster, tea cup ride, an up and down parachute ride, several rides that go in circles in different vehicles (e.g., planes, cars, and helicopters and futuristic flying machines), and a bumper boats ride that turns into a splash pad in the summer.  Determining whether the adults need a wrist band or tickets is always a little tricky as adults are needed on some rides, but not others, and it also depends on the age of the child.  The place has a little bit of a rundown feel, but kids don't notice and have loads of fun.  The arcade is really rundown, but the ATM is really nice.  There isn't much shade, so be prepared.  All of the staff are really nice.\n\nThere are usually a few game and art vendors about: ball toss game, sand art, and/or face painting.

We were at the Ulta just around the corner and she said she was hungry and she LOVES pizza.  We have been here twice as of this writing.  The second time around was \"Kids Eat Free\" night.  That is Wednesay for those of you with kids and it's a good deal.  I will eventually put together a list of Kids Eat Free places in the area.  For now let me tell you about NYPD.....\n\nThe pizza is a winner!  Nice crust, great topppings!  They use paper thin slices of sausage instead of hunks of sausage.  The flavore is great too.  My daughter had a slice of black olive pizza and they were very generous with the olives....she loved it!  I have had the ceaser and the house salads and both were good and fresh.  \n\nSo for the Kids Eat Free night adults need to order an entree (I think this includes a whole pizza too, not sure though) There were several things to choose from including cheese ravioli, baked ziti, and  lasagne.  I chose the lasagne and it was delish!  Piping hot with melted mozeralla over the top, I could not stop eating it!!  The flavors melded together nicely and it reminded me of my Mom's lasagne.  And did I mention the bread......OMG!!  The little ibites of heaven are sooooo good!!  I could have eaten ten of them!!  They are homemade, the real deal, yeasty goodness!!  Warm and just a little chewy, the flavor was amazing!!  \nOh and the Desert Flower Ice Tea.....so refreshing!!!  I keep thinking about it, that's how good it is!!\n\nTry the canollis.....you won't be disappointned.  Kids get an ice cream sundae with their meal.  On our first visit Lori, our server, was a real sweetheart.  She gave me some coupons and signed me up for the email list.  And on our next visit , Jessica was awesome and attentive too!\n\nThis is a small place but they also have an outdoor patio with misters.  The bar is tiny, probably seats 10.  Flat screen for watching the D'backs and some good beers on tap, along with Happy Hour specials makes this a great place!!  This will be somewhere we will frequent!!

It's extremely basic, no frills, and cheap.  The baklava isn't fabulous, but everything else is worthy of a special trip.  Once again, the chicken shawarma draws me in, though I'll occasionally force myself into breaking out of that far too predictable mold (for falafel since I truly am stuck in a rut).  The hummus is great.  As mentioned, the salads mainly consist of iceburg lettuce, but they are not stingy with the feta and the dressing is amazing.\n\nThere is night, semi-scrubby outdoor seating and the drinks are bottled or canned.  Last year I went with a group of friends for Valentine's Day and there was a musician who was slightly too loud for the environment.  When something special is going on, the owner comes around and checks with the patrons to verify quality and whether or not the activity is enjoyable.  This is always a nice classy touch for a little dive.\n\nIt's a rarer occasion that I find my way down there.  Let's be honest: I only go that direction for SMoCA, the Venue of Scottsdale, and EZ Tattoo.  It's not generally \"my scene\" and it's definitely out of my way.  Any time I find myself doing something in downtown Scottsdale, however, dinner at Pita House prior to the main event is an absolute must.","5":"review","6":"YMB29SPB8Z_a2be4O5gxOg","7":"3","8":"4","9":"0"},{"0":"ut-kla-EA23nJOij_dcL0Q","1":"2007-02-15","2":"36LZ2UOhAwa8p-nyQgbN5Q","3":"3","4":"If you have been to one CPK, you have more or less been to all of them.

The black dragon chicken was good, but not great. After we left, we noticed the dinner menu was much more extensive, especially without the tapas. Maybe dinner here is a much better experience, but I'm not sure I'd even be willing to give it a try after the lunch I had here. As for the atmosphere and decor - don't even get me started. Talk about trying too hard to be hip. The Vegas-y blue lighting in the bar area, the Northwest coffehouse style old-looking couch in the back, the Asian influence...I'm not a proponent of \"matchy-matchy\" decor, but this was all over the place.

I found this place on Yelp and came here while on a trip to Arizona.  The place was pretty crowded but we only  waited about 15-20 minutes.  We ordered babyback ribs, St. Louis ribs, corn, and mac&cheese.  They also give you DELICIOUS AMAZING CORNBREAD!\n\nEverything was excellent.  The St. Louis ribs were the best ribs I have ever had.  They were extremely tender and had a nice flavorful bark on the  outside with dark grill marks.  Their BBQ sauce was equally awesome and the kind I like -- a bit more on the sweeter side, less on the vinegary side.  The babyback ribs were also tasty, but not as flavorful (and less meat of course) than the St. Louis ones.  The sides were good but more forgettable due to the sheer perfection of their ribs.\n\nI don't know if I will ever be in Phoenix again, but this place is a must-return if I ever am.  Oh and at the end of the meal, they gave us complimentary, piping hot FRESH cinnamon donuts!  That double-won me over.

A great way to spend the day when it's hitting over a hundred degrees!  It's about a forty-five minute drive from Phoenix.\n\nI went on a Saturday afternoon, around three or so.  So, I missed the huge crowds and rowdy bunch, along with the sun at it's hottest point!  It's about a two to three hour ride from the shuttle drop off point two to the pick up point four.\n\nRentals are $14/pp, which includes your tube rental and shuttle service.  This is the all day rate, so if you get there in the morning, you can go back again and again.  It's $10/pp without the tube rental.  You can also rent a tube for your ice chest (styrofoam coolers are not recommended as they float away), which is a must as you need to load up on TONS of water and your beverage of choice.\n\nBring along tons of sunblock and reapply often.  Bring a hat though because you'll be glad you did when you see all the sunburn faces around you.  A few old bedsheets will feel like a godsend on your hot tube, so think about bringing those along too!  And bring along a pair of cheap water shoes or old sneakers because it's definitely rocky and you will need to climb out of the river at the end.  Flip flops or loose sandals are not recommended as you see them floating on by in the fast current.  (Don't be foolish and bring your new expensive sunglasses aka 'spies' to show off because you'll look like an idiot when you lose it!)\n\nAnd yes, the river is dirty - with river grass, pee, marshmallows, every other kind of food possible, etc.  But you hope with the quick current flowing, that it makes the water less dirty...you hope at least.  And please take your trash with you!  (The shuttle drivers offer decent plastic trash bags for free, so please take a couple with you on the river!)\n\nThey require that children be a minimum of 8 years old AND four feet tall before they'll allow you on the shuttles to take you down to the river.  It can be a fast river, but also because of the mostly high school and college aged crowd frequently and dominating the river.\n\nIt's open 9 am to 7 pm, seven days a week.  The last tube rental is at 4 pm, and lost tubes will cost you $20 each.  You need a driver's license for every four or five tube rentals.  And no glass containers!

My normal concerns with such eateries--will the food be maintained at a proper food-safe temperature, is this seafood fresh, how long has the sushi been sitting out, will I be able to make it home before my intestines rupture--dissipated because Hoa knows good Asian cuisine. She is, of course, born to Vietnam and world traveled. \n\nLet's start with my happiest aspect about HKGB: the sushi. No, it's not the best sushi in the Valley, but they make it fresh for you on site. You can stand there and watch it being make, grab a soup or something else to munch on, or just sit at your table and chat awhile. Afterwards, you can head back for more sushi or veer over to the more traditional offerings of a Chinese buffet: sweet and sour chicken, fried rice, crab legs. \n\nNow let's review the not-so-shiny aspect: the price. Yes, it seems a little steep that we paid about $25 per person with tip (and I made only two rounds) but when you factor in the 2 hours we spent there, grazing, catching up, grazing, passing Lisette's daughter around, grazing and making plans to keep in touch, it's really not such an outrageous amount to pay. \n\nIf you find yourself in this part of town, craving Chinese and are wicked crazy hungry, give HKGB a shot.","5":"review","6":"nc3cqVN0UuB3m50-CcMftw","7":"10","8":"11","9":"2"},{"0":"mM_sT64i46AKPQtz26PCcg","1":"2011-08-24","2":"ZBrl8qRkHeYr3XLQw6_ZJQ","3":"4","4":"One of the better places to get some frozen yogurt, and since this is the location closest to my house, we tend to come here more than any other place we have been to so far. \n\nThere is no indication next to the names of the yogurts what ingredients are in it, so I am docking a star for that. I'm trying to avoid eating eggs as much as I can and it is always helpful when that information is available without having to ask. I have been on the website enough times now to know which flavors have eggs and which don't so its not a problem for me anymore, but for anyone else it would be. But the flavors I have had have all been good. The fruity pebble flavor I had awhile ago actually tasted just like the cereal. It was a fun flavor. \n\nThe topping bar is a good size. There are fruits, candies, and nuts among other toppings. My husband and I are generally happy with this topping bar. \n\nThe best thing about this location is on Wednesdays, if you come in wearing pajamas (or something resembling pajamas) you get 50% off your total! Its a great deal. The last time we only paid $5 for the two of us. It gets pretty busy on Wednesdays but its not too bad.","5":"review","6":"2nXFEyQ06RfcdAXIPbxuwA","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"Zx8_4zKdDBSO3qGrkukBIA","1":"2008-11-18","2":"zVPF4RaGG7jpfQ63HRVGcQ","3":"5","4":"LOVE Chino Bandido.

The hubs ordered the Tenderbelly Pork Shank. \n\nThe chopped salad has earned its reputation. That thing is de-freaking-licious. The Pork Shank dish was fabulous as well, but I couldn't get over how great the salad was! AND the server always came over to make sure that my wine glass was never empty. Seriously, can it get any better?\n\nFor dessert we ordered the spumoni- I have had better (no offense) but I'm not sure anything served after that salad would have made me happy :)\n\nI'm very glad we finally made it to Cowboy Ciao and I look forward to going back - SOON!","5":"review","6":"g9s_yIDg9uA3RufY8-cqtA","7":"1","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"npNGjnLuB16sU_6T2b-5bA","1":"2010-01-11","2":"cat5mQdwKeXF--LgMm1ESQ","3":"4","4":"This is our theater of choice in N Scottsdale.

Our server checked on us several times as well.  We started with vegetable pot stickers and requested that they come steamed.  They were delicious! Next, we shared 'Indian Curry Vegetables' (I ordered it with shrimp) and Indian Vindaloo Chicken.  Both were extremely tasty - fresh veggies, chicken, and shrimp in really flavorful sauces with just the right amount of spice.  The curry vegetable dish came with broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, snow peas, and long beans.  The chicken dish had tomatoes and onions. We also had steamed white rice.\n\nNote to Flo: We were both disappointed that you took the Vietnamese Spring Rolls off of the menu and I miss the days of the green curry dish with calamari. One more thing - the chicken corn soup that you serve at the DC Ranch location should be offered at the others as well - I love that soup!\n\nFortune cookies came along with the check and we both were happy with our fortunes.

The red jalapeño and fresh cilantro on top brought excitement to each bite. \n\nThe dishes are small, but they are are also inexpensive at $6-10 each. Along with the chips and salsa, I got plenty of food, so portion sizes are only an issue for big eaters. It seems like a great place to share several dishes between everyone. \n\nI would definately go back for the food, but I wonder if this place becomes a standing-room only drunk fest when it gets busier and later in the evening (if so, no thanks).","5":"review","6":"qQns9dP75RNOWOVWI_ZKZw","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"7pxa5tueoEcmt6hztqsz2A","1":"2008-12-10","2":"hMD_kV9jYdZ8PzCZoqtmMA","3":"5","4":"Just because i feel like doing something different. :P\ni'm just going to paste some song lyrics that i feel sum up Pei Wei on McDowell...\n\nTruth is here the truth is here\nTruth is here the truth is here\nTruth is here the truth is here\nI said the truth is here the truth is here\n\nI want more\nGive me more\nWe want more\nGod damn it I'm back to demand we get more\nWe want more\nI want more and more and more\nI want more\nWe need more\nI want more\nGod damn it I'm back to demand we get more\nGive me more\nI want more and more and more\n\n[Verse 1:]\nI stand here naked as the day I was born\nFace to the dawn and my faith in the song\nBlood soaking the pages I painted em' on\nAnd none of ya'll will take my place when I'm gone\nI'm the pure raw uncut, who the fuck want what\nHere to show you sucker ass mutts what's the fucks what\nBrother Ali vow solemnly not to die while the music is still inside of me\nIt's got to be allowed to breathe\nGot to let it out enough at least to let the monster flee\nI want more than what your offering me\nSongs that make me feel like I'm already free\nI'm a rebel in my own right\nYa'll don't want to write or think or speak a rhyme standing next to me\nWhen the game need it I'm exactly what it need\nPut the soul in the speech, let it go, let it be\n\n[Chorus: x2]\nI want more\nWe need more\nI want, god damn it I'm back to demand we get more\nGive me more\nI want more and more and more\n\nI said the truth is here the truth is here\nTruth is here the truth is here\nTruth is here the truth is here\nTruth is here the truth is\n\n[Verse 2:]\nNot nearly a single solitary soul\nStill put the kind of passion to the mic that I hold\nOne day it'll have to be pried from my cold dead hand\nUntil then the big man is gold\nGot one lone reason to go on breathing\nClimb into the zone of the evening, keep reaching\nJust to pull more out the core of the deamon\nThe people need to see them pure human being\nBlood, sweat, love, hate, life, death, joy, pain\nLittle child running wild striped to the raw veins\nRugged junkyard dog off the chain, barefoot balls out marching in the rain\nSacred war dance suspended in the moment\nWe throw the fuck down like our lives depended on it\nJaws of the streets with our heart on our sleeve\nThrowing shots at the law which is all I believe\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\n[Verse 3:]\nOur songs are supposed to be the voice of our soul\nNot bought and sold, not all controlled\nBring a little fire when the world get cold\nLet me shed a few tears and to me you went gold\nPeople need more freedom\nChildren need to hear more truth when ya'll teach em'\nDamn I want to hear a plan from the dude preaching\nGot new seeds with true needs and who's leading\nI truly believe every word I've ever uttered on a drum break\nRight or wrong, life go on but it wasn't nothing fake\nI demand you start listening to the crowd\nIf not - we gon burn this bitch to the ground\n\n[Chorus x2]\n\nI said the truth is here the truth is here\nTruth is here the truth is here\nTruth is here the truth is here\nTruth is here the truth is\n\n\nthe atmosphere is pretty hot here too..exposed brick always makes me Yelp!","5":"review","6":"E5QyEU6FCQwnTys0S73zNw","7":"2","8":"2","9":"3"},{"0":"o9nCXNC14VScabiy2bftgw","1":"2007-02-05","2":"FRq9MZnoZltnwh_lAYiQAw","3":"4","4":"Holy manfest '07.\nI think I was one of the 20 women (not including the waitresses) in Tilted Kilt yesterday.\nIt was raining men.

One of those places where the early cowboys of the SW would appreciate.  \n \nIf you are a cracker family, I suggest going super early, like super early bird special early , like when the snow birds come out for the senior special early, because after dusk, the whole place transforms into a pulsating super loud, super dicey Mexican Dance Club, and the blue hairs are sure to have a coronary attack after indulging in such a  lipid laden meal as they attempt to make their way out of the Club.  \n \nAh the sacrifice for decent BBQ....","5":"review","6":"die-1gtgzw5KcyUjKo-VSg","7":"1","8":"1","9":"1"},{"0":"heszpsyNiT3i8MEOk04sUw","1":"2012-08-30","2":"PQRwGcpCCVYVIdluLmn0gA","3":"5","4":"I live in two cities in two different states and travel back and forth each month.  I tend to use services where I find them and haven't really found a  really great barbershop in the last three years.  While I was in Anthem this week, I decided to give Vs Barbershop at Happy Valley Road a try.  I rarely use chains and prefer a more intimate and personal hair stylist, but I was pleasantly surprised this time.  I was able to make my appoinmtnt online and choose the services I wanted to have with the haircut--very efficient.  I didn't know any of the barbers, so I just let the shop (?software) choose one.  I was treated to a superb haircut, a very satisfying shave, and a facial mask and massage.  My barber, Manuel, was precise, experienced, and he went about his business with style. I cannot imagine how many hot towels he used but I would not want their laundry bill. Finally, Manuel washed my hair AFTER the cut, which makes all the difference for the rest of the day. The overall experience was excellent and I am sure to return the next time I am in town.  Yes, the package was pricey but the haircut was standard price for this type of service. This is no Supercuts or Hair Salon--trust me on that.  If you are looking for that old style Barber experience with more than just a clipped head, please give Vs a try.  By the way, it is just behind Paradise Bakery in The Shops at Norterra.","5":"review","6":"TLxb5zxzXO-Y0bFB__i53g","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"7tTK3VPlFtBGBHm8-LZIUg","1":"2012-08-24","2":"pX2ROPQLKnnnEU86JunAHA","3":"5","4":"Awesome place!!

I went down to Cheuvront with a few friends for Restaurant Week.  The place is tiny, very relaxed-hip looking, and right on Central Ave.  While the place doesn't have any distinct look or theme going on, there was a movie with french subtitles playing on a screen next to the dining area so...I guess it's supposed to be French.  They have wine and cheese too, so, yeah, probably French.\n\nSo the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.\n\nThat was when they pulled out dessert.\n\nI'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.\n\nI have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.\n\nBefore I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.\n\nWhile it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks.","5":"review","6":"lczLjHO7zIhrmSlOXI3ohg","7":"1","8":"1","9":"1"},{"0":"mhQCxOiqp03qnhGRTtPduw","1":"2011-03-24","2":"mlg4QXm6F9RoRGqjHIRx3w","3":"5","4":"This is my favorite pho joint in all of Arizona.

The food is as awesome as ever. The service is much as it has always been. Be forewarned, trendy restaurant goers, who glom onto TV reviews, Mrs. White's is not trendy; there are no bubbly fresh blonde girls waiting to seat you. The service is matter of fact, no goofing around, you must get to the business of ordering and pretend you know what you are doing - this is the way it has always been at Mrs. White's. If you are looking for others to pamper you, this is not the place for that. Mrs. White's is where you go to pamper your indulgence for perfect soul food. If you want Scottsdale ambiance, again, this joint won't work for you.\n\nWhen you go, be prepared that not all dishes may be on the menu during your visit. There are no corporate owned semi-trailers that deliver two tons of food every other day. This is a small and very cramped operation that makes homemade food for those who know how to appreciate it. In these days of flash frozen prepared dishes that are uniform from visit to visit at chain restaurants, this food is made in a tiny hot kitchen. If they run out of your favorite dish that has been cooking for hours prior to your arrival, there is no way they can whip up another pot of green beans and potatoes in 20 minutes. \n\nI often call ahead to verify if they have what I want because years ago it was not uncommon that by 12:30 they would be out of half of everything on the menu, which was OK because if forced me to try new things Back then, Mrs. White's was open Monday through Friday from 11:00 till 3:00, but I'd swear you'd be lucky to get anything after 1:00 - and that was perfectly fine as you knew they were doing all they could with their limited space to do their best for us customers. I'd just come back on another day. \n\nTo say I have the utmost respect for the White family would be an understatement, today I was afraid I might have to lose that based on those poor reviews below. I do not believe those reviews are an accurate representation of The Golden Rule Cafe. They are the distortions and disappointments of people who have skewed expectations. Funky little hole-in-the-wall family-run operations that attract a loyal customer base may not be the place for everyone, but if you understand that wonderful stuff doesn't always come wrapped in a sterile designer package, then you might get along with Mrs. White's.\n\nI love this place and hope I always will.","5":"review","6":"5cVACUA-5e1SYyQ_E2-9iw","7":"2","8":"6","9":"1"},{"0":"y3V2jqKmvWjyo9Mc-Ipn4g","1":"2012-01-27","2":"F9BTRx7yCar_sDVwoOx7NA","3":"4","4":"Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good.

It's more flavorful than teeth loosening sweet and they have over 65 to choose from...although they rotate around about 6 of them per day.\n\nIt sure makes the moody blues go bye-bye with each spoonful.

I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, \"well we don't have anymore of that one.\"\n\nThanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche.

The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent. \n\nWhat I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty.

Had a very nice business dinner here last night.  We were able to sit outside thanks to the gorgeous weather, and I'd recommend this to anyone.  The houses inside have their charm, but al fresco dining is great!  \n\nWe had a few drinks at the bar before we started dinner - they have a fairly nice wine by the glass list, as well as a nice stocked bar.  Something for everyone!\n\nThe menu contained lots of delicious choices, and it was hard to choose.  Ended up going with Hapuku, which was a new-to-me fish from New Zealand, similar to grouper.  It was delicious - tender, flaky, and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement.\n\nWe had very polite service, though not well-timed.  I like when plates are cleared all at once for people, instead of taking plates at the table away when others are eating.  OR, bringing the bill before we've finished dessert.  Both of these happened here.","5":"review","6":"u760qQnKAwRkRhq6Fn8yzA","7":"1","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"90AXjqb4O-wrTHDKDoDUzg","1":"2011-08-28","2":"4Jr7NZisSBxabb-lGLRadg","3":"4","4":"Food and atmosphere, it's excellent for me.

Apparently the serving is large as the server hinted that it may be too large for me, but the serving was typical for a Fruits de Mare type plate that I've had at other restaurants. Sauce was nice: spicy and good flavor. Pasta was cooked well and the right portion size, I think people add too much pasta to make the dish look larger. Other than the imitation crab (a disappointment but not a deal breaker) the seafood was cooked nicely between the calamari, mussels, etc. \n\nKid's spaghetti was very good. I taste all the kid's spaghetti since I have 3 kids and invariably someone doesn't finish or even start their bowl. The pasta was cooked well, the meatball was decent, but the sauce was shick and chunky (not watery which I hate) and covered all the pasta (which for some reason other restaurants can't seem to do). There isn't a specific kid's menu but the server said they make kid's portion size of anything on the menu but the price isn't available to be seen so you have to trust they aren't going to bend you over on those, which they didn't. \n\nBread, of course, was available prior to meals. The butter used is very tasty, some type of garlic I think. Bread was warm, soft, and not overcooked.\n\nNow I would have given 4 stars except for a few exceptions: the decor and slower service. \n\nDecor was dreadful, sorry. Old and dated. I think their target demographics is 50 years old or greater as the chairs, pictures, and everything inside screams 1970's. The chairs remind me of an old conference hall. The lighting is on the dark side. I guess if I was out on a date or with 4 retired couples, it would be a nicer decor, but with 8 adults and 5 kids it just doesn't fit quite right.\n\nKid friendly not quite, but kid accomidating is more like it. Since the ambience is darker and softer volume on conversations, having loud and obnoxious kids is not the right place for them.\n\nOverall, the food is good, servers friendly but not the family friendly place I usually prefer.","5":"review","6":"7o6OfRHsmcv44R1CjAh8dQ","7":"0","8":"2","9":"0"},{"0":"B30hnkwVSxvtem09QLgHiw","1":"2012-05-21","2":"6TL4GU4a7p0MzsFT7eo4Ow","3":"1","4":"False ads, do not stay there.

I stayed on the fifth floor \"cabana suites\" and as soon as my elevator opened up on the fifth floor, I knew right away I stayed at the wrong place. The \"suites\" were nothing more than a room with a tiny bit of extra elbow space that are on the rooftop area with a pool in the front of the room. The pool was NASTY! (see pictures I uploaded) It was green and looked disgusting and when I arrived to take a look, it had an \"out of order\" sign placed at the entrance. This place was embarrassing!

The only other thing is the lack of color selection for gels. If you are feeling like you need that electric blue, neon yellow or emerald green (color of 2013) then you are out of luck. \n\nAll in all I will probably be going here from now on unless I want a more trendy color other than Red.

I'm from Jersey, everybody in my family raves about Jersey Mikes and they are all in Jersey.  First off,  I ordered the Italian sub that comes with the works (5 different meats) and is supposed to come with provolone.  Got home to Buckeye to learn there was no provolone on my sandwich.  That throws the taste of an Italian sub off, period.  My second disappointment was the meat.  The franchise contracts out to a provisioner to make all their cold cuts under the Jersey Mike's label, but the meat does not have the flavor of New Jersey's finest deli meats, Thumann's. Boar's Head doesn't come in close to Thumann's but I'll take Boar's Head when nothing else is available. Third place goes to Dietz and Watson.  If Peter Cancro, the CEO of Mike's really cares, he'll get his meat elsewhere. \n\nThe staff was very friendly, the restaurant was clean, there were blown up photos of the Pt. Pleasant side of the Manasquan Inlet and Jenk's pier with surfers heading out, a nice touch of back home, but that's the best I can say.

You get what you pay for.  We were happily surprised after reading the reviews...the food was amazing, the portions are huge and we had leftovers both times.  (and p.s., we paid with a debit card both times and have had no trouble, despite the review about only paying cash.)\n\nOur first visit, we were greeted kindly and given a plate of fruit to munch on until we ordered.  My husband ordered the mint tea and it was delish!  For an appetizer, we had the sabzi...which is a huge plate of green herbs, homemade wheat nan, feta cheese, and walnuts.  The herbs were FRESH and the nan was delicious...just the smell of it was enough to get us drooling!\n\nFor entrees, we had the spinach herb stew and the vegetable stew with eggplant.  I am currently pregnant and garlic is not something that's agreeing with me.  I asked if the vegetable stew had garlic in it and the waiter said \"we can make it however you want...every dish is made when you order it\"....what??  the dishes are made to order??  I haven't heard that at a lot of restaurants!  After about 20 minutes, our stews arrived...steaming hot and smelling delicious.  They were HEAVENLY!  So many flavors and so fresh!!\n\nOur second time here, we had the dolmeh plate and Mast Va Mosear (a spinach dip)...both were ok...but I like the Sabzi better.  The entrees we had were amazing...I had a special of the day (pomegranate walnut sauce over tofu, which was blissful to smell and eat) and hubby had the vegetarian sampler to get his falafel fix.\n\nOverall, if you are willing to pay a little more for a nice, organic foods dinner, go here and check it out.  Everything will be fresh...everything will smell and taste delicious...and the restaurant's atmosphere is perfect for a relaxed, decadent evening.","5":"review","6":"raMSkwLdZ-kFea1fTY_-Ew","7":"2","8":"3","9":"1"},{"0":"dwUCKSSDh-gnmLWQ6nr8CA","1":"2012-04-29","2":"IpgWj3_uS5s5x2L8MUkOOA","3":"4","4":"Funny how progress sometimes catches you off guard!

We purposely arrived early to have a drink at their bar.  There wasn't much of a selection on their happy hour drink menu so we just ordered our go-to drinks.  Champagne for her and a martini for me.  The hostess/waiter/waitress were very friendly and prompt.  When we were ready for dinner we were brought to the main dining area and our bar tab was transferred without trouble.\n\nI made a reservation a few weeks prior and made a notation that it was our anniversary.  Upon arrival at our table there was a card saying happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The table was smack in the middle of the dining room so my wife asked if we could move to another table.  The host was very accommodating and gave us a better table.\n\nThe place is pretty sheik to the eye but uncomfortable.  The 2-top tables are small, too close to other people, and I don't want to sound like a 90 year old, but the chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I don't know about you but I like to eat my too expensive meal in utter comfort.  The noise level is also above where it should be but they were playing some pretty solid tunes throughout the night.\n\nOur waitress was excellent and knowledgeable but was taking care of way too many tables which made her unable to come around as often as I would have liked.  I especially liked our sommelier who gave us an awesome wine recommendation.  Also, I'm not sure if this is all the time or not, but all bottles under $300 were 1/2 price so we splurged on a more expensive bottle than we would have normally purchased.\n\nThe Food:\n\n* Fries - they give these to you instead of bread.  They are excellent especially the truffle ones.  My only issue is that you could tell they were sitting out for a half hour before being served to us.  I would have liked them fresh but whatever.\n* Wedge Salad - just ok.  The blue cheese and bacon were great though.  It just wasn't the typical steak joint wedge I am used to and was looking forward to.\n* Burrata Cheese - this was very unique to me and pretty good\n* Truffled Mac n' Cheese - not the best I've ever had but still pretty good.  Not as thick and cheesy as I would have liked and they use weird noodles.\n* Wagyu Beef Trio - My wife and I shared this.  Perfect amount for the both of us to share.  Each 4oz piece of steak was perfectly cooked, juicy and delicious.  I still can't tell the difference between regular beef and wagyu though.  The sides were also very good.  We especially liked the mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes were too creamy and just eh.\n* Beignets - we shared these for desert and they are fluffy, sugary awesomeness.  The sauces are equally awesome.\n\nAll-in-all it was a fantastic meal and great experience.  Good food, good wine, good company.  I would come back any time to enjoy a steak or one of their burgers.","5":"review","6":"rLtl8ZkDX5vH5nAx9C3q5Q","7":"1","8":"3","9":"1"},{"0":"NSuT83Bl4LWtMP5nMfzHFw","1":"2012-02-09","2":"vttXONTHncmzMcdBj9hZlA","3":"5","4":"Very very nice family owned bookstore that allows you to trade in your books and buy other books for half price. The owners have also recommended many books/authors to my family over the years.\n\nI came in today still seeking a book that I have gone to numerous libraries looking for. I found a copy on the shelf that was much bigger than an ordinary paperback. I asked if they might have any additional copies. The owner was so nice and went in the back room not once but twice to find me the book and it's sequel. I was so thrilled to have found the books!\n\nI believe that almost every year they have a book clearance where they sell off many books for only $1. I won't be in town for it but if anyone is, I recommend checking it out!","5":"review","6":"cKEkbRkYcYtWymUF8Zxolw","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"-h-q6zTIdPlkz9BDP11sBg","1":"2012-10-09","2":"rGFVSbE73Q4hPuGNVmqMUA","3":"4","4":"Our second experience here was much better.

I am all about the alcohol infused ice cream now. The funny thing about that is I am not even a big ice cream lover.

They offer a HUGE variety of loose teas from all around the world. They have herbal, rooibos, green, black, and white teas. The selection is phenomenal and there is some loose teas here for every type of tea drinker out there. They also offer high quality tea accessories that are beautiful like the teapots and tea mugs which are very classy and not overly expensive. Great place for those looking to pick up a unique gift for a tea lover or for the tea lovers like myself it is like stepping into tea HEAVEN. The owner is also very nice and offers good advice if you are looking for a particular taste or type of tea since there are at least 50-60 loose teas to choose from.

I have been going there for a couple years - have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered.  Their beans are delicious, as is their menudo (only on Saturday and Sunday, unfortunately), and eveything else: tacos, burritos, enchiladas, chile rellenos, etc, etc, etc. is great.  It is so inexpensive it's hard to believe.  Today my bff and I had 5 tacos and an order of beans (between us) and it was $10. HELLO! We had the mini-tacos, but we were stuffed and left there saying how wonderful it was and how full we were.\n  Check it out next time you're in the mood for some awesome, authentic Mexican food.  You will be glad you did.

The grounds are kept clean and tidy, except for some irresponsible pet owners. Some of them even let their pets run around leash-less or cannot control them. But that is not the management's issue.\n\nPros:\n1. The apts are spacious, well-built.\n2. Grounds are clean and grass is maintained.\n3. Pool is well-maintained.\n4. Online system for rent pay and maintenance tickets is great.\n5. Price is great for the value.\n\nCons:\n1. Apts not sound-proof or heat-proof.\n2. Sprinklers tend to sprinkle more water over the sidewalks than the grass area.\n3. Covered parking is extra $$$ and not enough of them anyways.\n4. Uncovered spots are all just crowded in the parking lot at the back.\n5. Security gates are open most of the time from the front and have gaps that could let an adult through on the sides.\n6. Outer compound Walls are not high enough to actually prevent/make it difficult for an intruder.\n7. Fitness center is adequate at best. Most of the free weights and equipment (except the machines) are broken or missing. The machines work ok, but are not maintained well.\n8. Leasing office employees could use a bit more smile and inter-personal skills.","5":"review","6":"ZREYKjErXkcoeqUw6gRQtw","7":"0","8":"5","9":"0"},{"0":"-PA_1J9JzxLcluTOw2gZjw","1":"2012-04-27","2":"MNjiCQavIbMZpuBGSbGp9Q","3":"1","4":"Not worth the money.

As far as municipals in the Valley are concerned, this is as good as it gets (Aguila is a close second).  No overbearing marshalls.  Rates that top out at $28 in the winter.  Above average range and practice area, including two large putting greens.  Cheap pitchers of beer.  A long-time cart lady who will spray your face with water in the summer!  \n\nAs far as the course itself, this is not typical AZ golf - there are no cacti, only tree-lined fairways and some water sprinkled throughout to pose as threats.    But there are birdies to be had, and lots of them; #1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15 and 18 are the best chances in my experience (I consider this my home course).  The greens are usually pretty moderate speed to slow - this is grainy bermuda, not some hybrid or bent grass, so prepare to run the putts into the back of the hole.  #5 is my favorite hole, a short-par 5 that gives you the chance to hit over a tree left and drive the narrow fairway, leaving you a long to mid-iron into an elevated green that slopes toward you.  #8 is a formidable challenge if you have the tendency to block (or slice, as may be the case) the ball from time-to-time, as your ball will face a watery grave.  #16 is a tricky tree-lined hole with a tight driving area and doglegs right.  And finally, #18, a short par 5 that is easily reachable and where a par feels like a bogey.  A scant 6600 yds from the blue tees (but rarely plays it's full length), there are some low scores out there.\n\nA great course, value, practice area, and recently renovated restaurant and bar - 5 stars.","5":"review","6":"dQO0tQISZyb9L4d5ASnXyQ","7":"0","8":"1","9":"0"},{"0":"roTWGaU-RcJ06l8cjFw7xQ","1":"2007-11-27","2":"KpnYRPGPVAAh3tl8NUuGHg","3":"2","4":"I don't know why i have been here more than once, but the parking is horrible, and the food is only so-so.  lots of color and flare but not much going for it.  the baja sauce is great but i seem to get sick later that evening when i eat it.  i need to learn from experience","5":"review","6":"GAW_mbLDbIoZQ0V0ZhWK8Q","7":"0","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"V2isTBBfO0NgLzXO9oq1Mg","1":"2007-08-13","2":"pehsPum9iW6DVyWil6WhFQ","3":"5","4":"Mouth watering. That's all I have to say.\n\nThe food at this place is seriously amazing. Everything we tasted was better than the dish before it, and we had a fabulous bottle of white wine to accompany our meal. The scallops were a highlight, as was the potato pie dish (that's not a very technical name for what it was, but that's my best effort). It was all very, very good, and the only thing keeping us from returning is the cost! We genuinely enjoyed our evening here, and we will absolutely go back, but it is pricey, especially for the size of the dishes.\n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance are so fun, and this place is a little dressier and trendier than some other places we've been in Scottsdale. I highly recommend this for a night out with friends, or a cool date night. It seemed as though reservations would be a good idea, although we didn't have them and were okay (it was busy, though).","5":"review","6":"9FbgqZ5u9WTLAs28nNafIQ","7":"1","8":"0","9":"0"},{"0":"WUZxVr_CaRqEQgzvyeK5tw","1":"2012-03-25","2":"1v3rPVXx6RDWjgIUTfVLpw","3":"5","4":"IKEA is so much fun.
